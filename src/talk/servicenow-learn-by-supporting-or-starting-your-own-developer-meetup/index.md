event_url: "https://servicenow.g2planet.com/knowledge2019/myevent_session_view.php?attendee_id=4524&session_id=326&agenda_session_id=260"
location: "Las Vegas, NV"
summary: "This was the accepted presentation given at Knowledge 19 in Las Vegas on how to support your meetup"
abstract: "Introduction and Problem Statement: Two years ago I started a Developer Meetup for servicenow talent to do ad-hoc labs and have happy hours.  I didn't want what happened to the SNUG's happening to this event so I volunteered.  

Approach and Results: Running the event has been a ride and I would do it all over again.  In this session I'll go over what it takes to run these events.

Attendees will learn how to:

    Identify how often and about what the meetup should meet about.
    Finding content to use for labs and / or for happy hour discussions.
    Finding hosting locations in your area."
