Hi! I'm **Jace Benson**, a ServiceNow Developer and web enthusiast based in Robbinsdale, MN. I work on web technologies every day with ambition to learn more about what makes the web work. I love working on new things to me often, lately that's Ruby and Javascript.

## What I Do

Currently, I'm a **ServiceNow Architect at Lumen Technologies** where I:

- Build proof-of-concept solutions for Field Service Management and Case Service Management
- Create custom interfaces to track required data for Field Technicians

## My Journey

I've been working with ServiceNow since 2007, starting as a Senior Integration Consultant at Fruition Partners and working my way through various roles at companies like Expedia, FICO, AgilitiHealth, and Delta Air Lines. Throughout this journey, I've:

- Led ServiceNow upgrades and implementations
- Created integrations with various platforms and services
- Mentored colleagues and contributed to developer communities
- Built automation solutions that save time and improve efficiency

## Community Involvement

I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and contributing to the ServiceNow community:

- **Content Creator**: I maintain several projects and resources for the ServiceNow community

## Projects & Side Ventures

When I'm not working on ServiceNow, I create tools and resources to help developers:

- **[News Jace Pro](https://news.jace.pro)** - A ServiceNow news aggregator
- **[nullEDGE conference](https://thenulledge.com)** - The conference I wished existed for ServiceNow, now a reality

## Technical Skills

I work with a variety of technologies including:

- **Languages**: HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, XML, Jelly, PHP, SQL, and Ruby on Rails
- **Libraries**: jQuery, Angular, Prototype, Node.js, React, RedwoodJS, and 11ty
