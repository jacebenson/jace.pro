This starter uses modern CSS, fluid type & space, flexible Layouts and Progressive Enhancement, wrapped in a basic template.

It is built around the CSS boilerplate by Andy Bell and inspired by Andy's talk **'Be the browser’s mentor, not its micromanager'**.

If you want to know exactly how it all works, [read this article on piccalil.li](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-css-project-boilerplate/).

The aim is to spread the idea and use of this _excellent_ workflow. To work with it efficiently you should be familiar with [cube.fyi](https://cube.fyi/), [utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/) and [every-layout.dev](https://every-layout.dev/).
