title: Platforms (icons)
---

Find and set your platform icons in `src/assets/svg`, in the "platform" directory.

In `src/_data/personal.yaml` you can edit the platforms. The key should be the same as the name of the icon. For example: `mastodon: 'https://front-end.social/@lene'` and `src/assets/svg/platform/mastodon.svg`.

https://simpleicons.org/ features a great variety of free SVG icons for popular platforms.
