title: Tags
---

This was probably the most opinionated decision: tags have been integrated since version 2.0.

The tags are placed in the front matter of the posts, using the syntax

```yaml
tags:
  - image
  - feature
```

or

```md
tags: ['markdown', 'feature']
```

If you generally do not want any tags to show, it is probably easiest to not create any at all.
