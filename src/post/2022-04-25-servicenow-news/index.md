K22
Carleen Carter started a thread about getting ready to go.
- Break in your shoes, (do not bring new shoes) Protip, use a hair dryer to heat up your shoes and wear them around the house so they mold to your feet, also ?duct tape on hot spots?
Others chimed in with other great advise;
- Keep a change of socks in your bag to swap out (running socks are the best)
- For the folks who aren't wearing flats, consider it and some low slung socks.
- Pack a COVID test
- If you're not used to sleeping in a city, consider earplugs and a eye-mask.
