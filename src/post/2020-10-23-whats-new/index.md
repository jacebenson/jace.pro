I think I'm going to start some sort of review of the content from my news aggregater.

I'm not sure what format this will end up in but I'll start here in written form.

Let's dig in.

There's some great content for the Creatorcon 2020 event.  So far 

- [Prosenjit Sengupta - UI Builder: Build a Space App dashboard for Mars Rovers, Astro Images and NEOs](https://players.brightcove.net/5703385908001/zKNjJ2k2DM_default/index.html?videoId=ref:CC20-CCB1010)
  This is great.  He shows a lot of the functionality of the Now Components and Experience with the builder.  It's 22 minutes, or 11 if you can run at doublespeed.

  Brad went deep in here to help share this understanding of graphQL.  If you don't get it.  I'd look here.
