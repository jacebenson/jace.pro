The other day I was on my computer when I got a message.

"Hey Jace, Do you have any thoughts on getting a job working on ServiceNow during these times?" (I wasn't asked this specifically but the conversation went down that way)

Oof, when asked this the first thing I do is consider myself losing my employment.  I cannot begin to know the worry they have.  

These are terrible times. I wish you all best, but every time I try to get involved getting someone a gig or job things go sideways fast. So I stopped doing that. Now I just tell people... the stuff below. That's why I'm writing this. So I can share it use it to cover all the things.

Since March I've been watching [slack](https://sndevs.com) cautiously.  Reading about lay offs and furloughs.  

I encourage everyone in this space to listen to [Robert Fedoruk and CJ Wesley's podcast featuring Kyle Carson](https://share.transistor.fm/s/bfec71fc).

## Thoughts on getting a job working on ServiceNow

First you need to land an interview.  To do that, make an amazing resume.  Some say a resume isn't important, some say it is.  I like my resume and trying to make it look good, but it's a weird thing.  A piece of paper listing skills, history, accomplisments and why you want to work there.

### Resumes are the tickets to interviews

There's lots of things online about resumes. I don't have concrete evidence on what works and what doesn't, so I'll share my thoughts from my experience.

I have a "Base" resume I keep up to date with all my experience and such, and I make copies of it tailored to companies needs.

1.  **Keep it current.**               - Update that resume anytime you get a job with the tasks or skills they list.
2.  **Don't lie.**                     - It's easy to lie, not so easy to get away with it. I wouldn't want to hire a liar.
3.  **Describe creatively.**           - "Handled integrations." becomes, "Saved 5 hours per week per person automating ServiceNow to Payroll feeds."
4.  **Know your skills.**              - An admin and a developer can look the same on paper.
5.  **Clean up your social media.**    - If they look you up, you don't want controversial things coming up.
6.  **Know your resume.**              - BE READY TO SPEAK ON EVERY THING YOU PUT ON THE RESUME.
7.  **Make it personal.**              - Tailor the resume to the job.  Use their lingo from their job posting.
8.  **Quantify your successes.**       - Numbers will find attention.
9.  **Enlist your community.**         - Share the details where you help others and they help you.
10. **Pair your resume down.**         - Be concise.  This isn't an biography.


You *should* update your resume per position applied.  Show your best sides to the potential employer. I've done this but not every time.

### Interviews are just conversations to give and get information

So since I'm still loving Hamilton I'm going to try something new;

**One**, **two**, **three**, **four**, **five**, **six**, **seven**, **eight**, **nine**... It's the **ten** jobby commandments.

1. **Focus and elevate.**               Know your worth and expect it.(I read [this](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation) to get there. **Every**. **Single**. **Time**.
1. **Make ready questions for people.** Screening call: benefits, culture, company expectations. Interview: team, and technical specifics.
1. **Apply to at least three places.**  One you don't want work at, and the rest you do.  Practice with the "don't" place.
1. **Take notes.**                      Use pen and paper to write stuff down during the all interview steps.  You won't regret it, and then you'll have it to reference later.
1. **Research. Research. Research.**    Understand the goals of each company.  What their lines of business are, and consider would you fit in there.
1. **Never give a number first.**       Goal: Figure out if you **want** to work here and if they **want** to hire you a lot.  When that's true, numbers are flexible.
1. **Listen and repeat.**               Pick out keywords from the job posting, and use them where appropriate.  Someone in the hiring chain will have written it.
1. **Money isn't everything.**          It's important. Sometimes a place can't offer you what you need. Consider negotiating extra time off where salary is set.
1. **"Interesting" is a great word.**   Them: We can offer you 80k.  You: 80k is interesting.  It's not quite where we need this.
1. **Defer to a EXTERNAL_AUTHORTY.**     This gives you a scapegoat for refusing a request while not being guilty of the refusal yourself.
