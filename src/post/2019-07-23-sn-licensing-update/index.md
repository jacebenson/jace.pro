# CONTENT REDACTED PER SERVICENOWS COUNCIL

I'm sad that I can't share the content I have seen in public spaces.  I don't want to cause more problems for anyone so I'm removing the content they've identified.  At this point, I'd suggest reaching out to your business contacts of similar size and industry to comparing notes.  Outside of that you'll have to meet with ServiceNow and get their pricing.
