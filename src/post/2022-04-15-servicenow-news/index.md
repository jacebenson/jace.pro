This bootcamp is new to me and has a lot of folks sharing what they are doing.  It sounds like they are all getting a ton of value out of this. I can't wait to hear more from these folks.

### Justin Meadows
 Talks about CSM/FSM configurable workspaces getting migrated over to the next experience and all about where these things all landed.  This is my first time seeing his content, on his youtube he has nearly 50 videos (some about running, some about ServiceNow) but I want to say I love the content and keep it going!

 Then he makes another video about Task Boards.  A feature I personally love that doesn't get enoguht love.  Justin shows how he tracks his work there.  Here he shows up this stuff he does.

### CJ & The Duke
Speaking of skills to build up, we have [CJ & The Duke give some ideas of things](https://share.transistor.fm/s/6dbaf0a4) to build to build your skills on ServiceNow.

### Extension Points by Matt Hernandez

Matt did a great article on community putting together a lot of great content about Extension Points.  They are powerful and if you haven't learned about them they are a tool you should be aware of.
