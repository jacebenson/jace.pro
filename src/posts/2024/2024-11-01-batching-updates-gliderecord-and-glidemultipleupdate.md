Update Many does not need `.query()`
Update Many does not work with `.chooseWindow()` or `.setLimit()`

> This does not work for inherited tables. For example if you inherit from task (incident, change) and try to use a field on task in your query clause, you will end up updating every record
> 
> How to do it:
> Normally when iterating trough a list of records, you would create a GlideRecord object, execute a query, iterate though each return and update the records one at a time.
```js
try {
   var mu = new GlideRecord("sys_user");
   mu.addQuery("column_to_search","value_to_search_on");
   my.query();
   while(mu.next()) {
      mu.column_to_set="new_value";
      mu.update();
   }
} catch(xx) {
  gs.log("Exceptionht: " + xx.message);
}
```
> Using this method also has a strong chance of timing out with larger data sets and face it, this is great for those paid by the hour, but in our situation where extra time is our time, there’s a better way to do it.
```js
try {
   var mu = new Packages.com.glide.db.MultipleUpdate("sys_user  mu.addQuery("column_to_search","value_to_search_on");
   mu.setValue("column_to_set", "new_value");
   mu.execute();
}
catch(xx) {
	gs.log("Exceptionht: " + xx.message);
}
```
> What this does:
> This package basically generates a SQL command that’s executed behind the scenes.
> In this case it would look something like:
> 
> `update sys_user set column_to_set="new_value" where column_to_search="value_to_search_on"`

> Because of its age it does use an old package call.   Here is an out of the box example of its use with import sets when you click "reprocess".   Make sure you use the new `GlideMultipleUpdate` API call instead.

```js
var mu = new GlideMultipleUpdate("sys_import_set_row");
mu.addQuery("sys_import_set", current.sys_id);
mu.setValue("sys_import_state", "pending");
mu.execute();
```

## Community Post - updateMultiple() doesn't update system fields
[Re: updateMultiple() doesn't update system fields ... - ServiceNow Community](https://www.servicenow.com/community/now-platform-forum/updatemultiple-doesn-t-update-system-fields-like-sys-updated-on/m-p/2616035/highlight/true#M190371)

> I'm surprised that this isn't documented anywhere else, but it seems this is a little known platform behavior. In almost all cases, `GlideRecord.updateMultiple()` is going to execute as an iterative update in the background (i.e. 1,000 records updated results in 1,000 UPDATE statements in SQL since we basically just loop over all the matching records and call `GlideRecord.update()` on them). During the iterative update operation, the business logic will execute that records the sys_ field changes (this is in the Java layer), but there is an exception. If you run `GlideRecord.updateMultiple` on a table that DOES NOT meet any of the criteria at the bottom, then it will not run as an iterative update, it will run as [GlideMultipleUpdate](https://www.servicenow.com/community/developer-forum/how-to-do-a-mass-update-all/m-p/1462600) (which I don't think we've ever officially documented) and it will execute a single database operation (i.e. 1,000 records updated results in only 1 UPDATE statement in SQL!). Another side effect of `GlideMultipleUpdate` is that it doesn't update the sys_ fields unless you explicitly tell it to.
