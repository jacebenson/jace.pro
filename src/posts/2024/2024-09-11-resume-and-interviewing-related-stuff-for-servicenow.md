Many times when folks connect with me on LinkedIn I'll ask "How can I help?" Sometimes I can actually help.

It's great.

Today I was asked by someone coming into this space ... What advice can I give to help someone find a job.

As I was sharing things, I thought I'd share them here as well.

A long time ago I was a patient escort.  I was bringing a man from xray back to his room.  Part of the job was to make small talk.  I wanted to work for IT in my bones back then.  He said he was a developer or administrator.  I asked him how can I get in to a role like that.  I expected to hear, "Goto school, get a degree."  That was never said.

He said.

> It's about who you know.  Not necessarily what.  

Ever since I've tried to do my best by knowing folks.  


Go, extend your network.  Goto the [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/servicenowdevprogram/), [snugs](https://www.servicenow.com/community/servicenow-user-groups-snugs/ct-p/servicenow-user-groups-snugs), partner happy hours, ServiceNow industry events and if you can swing it the summits, and conferences. 


Then make things to sharpen your blade.  Build something to solve a problem using ServiceNow, then **share it with others**.  Keep applying.

I would entrust the advice of Robert Fedoruk over most.  He's been working with organizations to place candidates, has run a finishing school of sorts and is very well versed in the value you need to bring to get the offer.  That being said he has number of things he's said in the past.  [Reach out to Robert](https://linktr.ee/robertfedoruk)

Mark Scott, Chuck Tomasi and Carleen Carter have also some great input on this.
