# I spent weeks comparing 9 email as a service providers. Here's what I found.

A few years ago I was set on building a tool called Tskr, I still am.  This post isn't about Tskr though.  You can read more on that at [tskr.io](https://tskr.io).  

This post is about the journey I took to find the best email as a service provider for Tskr.  I spent weeks comparing 9 email as a service providers.  Here's what I found.

These notes may be a bit dated but they are probably still relevant.  I hope you find them useful.
