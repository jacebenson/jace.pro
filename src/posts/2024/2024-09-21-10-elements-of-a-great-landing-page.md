Rob Walling is someone I often enjoy listening to and reading content he's a part of.

He spoke about this piece I keep coming back to about [10 elements of effective saas landing pages](https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-256-the-10-elements-of-highly-effective-saas-landing-pages)

I think you could apply this to a lot of things and I do.

I however have trouble finding this so I'm going to share the quick list here.

1. Design the landing page for first time visitors.  Give them One thing to do.
2. Have a great headline!  
    - Make a promise in the headline.
    - Have an action word, like a verb.
    - Either directly state "you" or "imply you".  Meaning, you're talkign to the person reading the headline.  E.g. Guaranteed to increase your organic traffic".  The promise is that it's *guaranteed to increase traffic*.  The action, verb, is *increase* and there's a you.  Here it's implied.  
    - You rarely should be talking about your app.
3. Have a visual element either an image or short vide to illustrate your product.
4. Highlight 3-9 benefits of your product
5. Social proof if you have it.  Testimonials, press logos, vanity metrics.
6. Optional features.  What features set your product apart?
7. Clear navigation.  Four or fewer links in the navigation bar.
8. Every page needs to have a clear call to action (not scroll to the top of the page)
9. Limit links and buttons to reduce decisions visitors have to make.
10. Footer links are a great place to put extra links.
