# K20 has gone digital

ServiceNow just announced it has gone digital for this event. Below is the statement from <https://knowledge.servicenow.com/faq.html#more_1>

> Over the past few weeks, we have been closely monitoring the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. In order to protect the health and safety of our Knowledge 2020 attendees, partners, and community, we have made the decision to make Knowledge 2020 a digital community event that will launch on May 5 in place of the in-person event in Orlando, FL.
>
> ~~As a Knowledge 2020 registrant, you will receive a full refund of your pass to the original form of payment. This will take 5-7 business days to complete and an email confirmation will be sent to you.~~
>
> The Knowledge 2020 digital experience will showcase all the ways you can unlock productivity through modern digital workflows, highlight the latest customer and platform innovations, and inspire the ServiceNow community to continue to create great experiences for businesses.
>
> In the coming days and weeks, we will provide details about the Knowledge 2020 digital experience. We are committed to creating a phenomenal digital experience that will engage, inspire, and connect you to the best practices from our customers around the world.
>
> The global health crisis is creating new realities for all of us. Thank you for your patience as we evaluated this fluid situation and assessed the best way forward to bring the ServiceNow community together in a safe and healthy manner. We regret we won’t see you in Orlando this year, but we are excited to stay connected digitally to share and learn from each other. That’s always been the power of the ServiceNow community.
>
> See you online!

Which has a lot of details.

## My take aways

It seems that ServiceNow has taken a page from Google's book here. That's fine. Great even. No reason to rethink some of these decisions.

* Full refunds of your pass. If you booked a hotel through Knowledge 2020 website, the reservation will be cancelled.
* A "digital experience" was mentioned three times in this short FAQ. It should engage, inspire, and connect individuals.

## What can we expect for a "digital experience"?

Here we get into what could be. If we look at other conferences that went digital, and ones that have always have been there seems to be some competing agendas.

1. Disseminating information. I assume will be done via Zoom Meetings or some other screensharing tool.
2. Connecting individuals. I assume this will be either not available, or some digital way, but in either case, it will be new and different. It will take getting used to.
3. Expo floor. I assume this will be either not available, or some digital way, but in either case, it will be new and different. It will take getting used to.

## How can we capitalize on this change?

Since everything will be digital, all streaming of ServiceNow stuff is nearly equal. If you're a small partner, spinning up YouTube Live or Twitch, you are not much different than however ServiceNow official will handle it in my opinion. With that being said I expect to see a lot of steaming video coming up out of this.
