In the past people have asked How do I [Remove an option from select box variable in the catalog item form](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_question&sys_id=1f5fb2a9db58dbc01dcaf3231f96199a)? And you'd think it would be something as simple as a `active` flag. However if you look there is no `active` flag on select box options. That is truly unfortunate.

If you delete it, the values will still hold their `value` but if there was a display for the value it won't show that.

## [How do I go forward?](https://jace.pro/post/2020-06-15-removing-options-from-choicelists-on-catalog/#how-do-i-go-forward)

There's really only one way I know of. Client script and remove the option until you can safely delete it.

The client script would be really small

```javascript
function onLoad(){
  g_form.removeOption('duration','twelve_months');
}
```

Another way... that is really overkill but I think handles it the best, is to disable the item and make a new version of the item.

* Deactivate the item
* Make a Copy - this ensures all past requests work as they were intended. It's a big change for a little bit of work I have seen this.
* Delete the option on the new version of the item
