The other day I was looking at something when I saw this post by Paul Morris called, "[Automating ATF - My Journey Building a Test Recorder](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=a4398aea1bb20c18fff162c4bd4bcbc8)". I had to try it out. It's a work in progress but it is so very promising.

A few things to note. As of right now it is only written to work on UI16, and there are some things that are still being worked on. Other projects like it are Jared Laethem's [Dotwalk.io Bootstrap](https://dotwalk.io/bootstrap)

When I tried Paul share out it created the steps, but a few steps weren't created. But it got a lot of the things. I may end up installing this on a sub=prod to generate the tests and then tweak as needed.

In any case you all should check out this tool and give your feedback on the [share page](https://developer.servicenow.com/connect.do#!/share/contents/5672333_regress_atf_service_catalog_test_generator).
