Last year I was pretty bitter about the hackathon. This year, I think the event will be better. Andrew Barnes and Brad Tilton are running this event. As I understand it these are the details;

First lets go over what you'll get out of this.

* You will learn how to build whatever it is you're building. So if you want to try out the new now-experience, here's your time to shine.
* You will likely form a team and make better bonds with those on it.
* You might win one the five categories, if you do you'll get $500 USD, or $5,000 USD for your team.
* ServiceNow may feature your work in some content sent out to people who want that kind of stuff.

Now let's go over the specifics.

| Questions                               | Answers     |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| How big can the teams be?               | 1-8 people. |
| When does it start?                     | May 1st.    |
| When does it end?                       | May 3rd.    |
| How many teams will be named winners?   | 5           |

Last year [I wrote up a detailed blog about winning hackathons](https://jace.pro/post/2019-04-22-knowledge-hackathon-past/) and reviewed all the past hackathons I could find (2013-2018).

May the odds be ever in your favor.
