# OK Orlando - A series of features worth note

In Orlando there's a bunch ofÂ [Automated Test Framework(ATF) updates](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-release-notes/page/release-notes/summary/rn-summary-new-features.html).

Lets go over them and see what we think;

## Copy an automated test suite

In the past copying a test suite kept the past scope.\
Lets see how good this works.

* If a suite spans multiple scopes, copying scopes doesn't copy anything out of the current scope.
* Copying a test suite isn't available unless you're in the suite's scope.

## Custom UI test steps - misleading

So in the new section there's a "Custom UI test steps" but it goes on to say;

> Test workspaces using the Form category test steps. The Custom UI category steps don't support available workspace.

So it's just a heads up, to test workspaces goto the form category, not custom ui.

## List and related list steps

* Validate related list visibility - tested
* Apply filter to list - tested
* Validate record present in list - tested - no way to validate list is empty or test that
* Validate ui actions in lists
* Open a record in list

## Email

* Validate outbound email
* Generate inbound reply email

## Other

* Generate Random String - only input is how long to make the input...
