The other day I was on my computer when I got a message.

"Hey Jace, Do you have any thoughts on getting a job working on ServiceNow during these times?" (I wasn't asked this specifically but the conversation went down that way)

Oof, when asked this the first thing I do is consider myself losing my employment. I cannot begin to know the worry they have.

These are terrible times. I wish you all best, but every time I try to get involved getting someone a gig or job things go sideways fast. So I stopped doing that. Now I just tell people... the stuff below. That's why I'm writing this. So I can share it use it to cover all the things.

Since March I've been watching [slack](https://sndevs.com/) cautiously. Reading about lay offs and furloughs.

I encourage everyone in this space to listen to [Robert Fedoruk and CJ Wesley's podcast featuring Kyle Carson](https://share.transistor.fm/s/bfec71fc).

## [Thoughts on getting a job working on ServiceNow](https://jace.pro/post/2020-07-30-opportunity-is-out-there/#thoughts-on-getting-a-job-working-on-servicenow)

First you need to land an interview. To do that, make an amazing resume. Some say a resume isn't important, some say it is. I like my resume and trying to make it look good, but it's a weird thing. A piece of paper listing skills, history, accomplisments and why you want to work there.

### [Resumes are the tickets to interviews](https://jace.pro/post/2020-07-30-opportunity-is-out-there/#resumes-are-the-tickets-to-interviews)

There's lots of things online about resumes. I don't have concrete evidence on what works and what doesn't, so I'll share my thoughts from my experience.

I have a "Base" resume I keep up to date with all my experience and such, and I make copies of it tailored to companies needs.

|                                    |                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. **Keep it current.**            | Update that resume anytime you get a job with the tasks or skills they list.                                 |
| 2. **Don't lie.**                  | It's easy to lie, not so easy to get away with it. I wouldn't want to hire a liar.                           |
| 3. **Describe creatively.**        | "Handled integrations." becomes, "Saved 5 hours per week per person automating ServiceNow to Payroll feeds." |
| 4. **Know your skills.**           | An admin and a developer can look the same on paper.                                                         |
| 5. **Clean up your social media.** | If they look you up, you don't want controversial things coming up.                                          |
| 6. **Know your resume.**           | BE READY TO SPEAK ON EVERY THING YOU PUT ON THE RESUME.                                                      |
| 7. **Make it personal.**           | Tailor the resume to the job. Use their lingo from their job posting.                                        |
| 8. **Quantify your successes.**    | Numbers will find attention.                                                                                 |
| 9. **Enlist your community.**      | Share the details where you help others and they help you.                                                   |
| 10. **Pair your resume down.**     | Be concise. This isn't an biography.                                                                         |

You *should* update your resume per position applied. Show your best sides to the potential employer. I've done this but not every time.

### [Interviews are just conversations to give and get information](https://jace.pro/post/2020-07-30-opportunity-is-out-there/#interviews-are-just-conversations-to-give-and-get-information)

So since I'm still loving Hamilton I'm going to try something new;

**One**, **two**, **three**, **four**, **five**, **six**, **seven**, **eight**, **nine**... It's the **ten** jobby commandments.

| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. **Focus and elevate.**              | Know your worth and expect it.(I read [this](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation) to get there. **Every**. **Single**. **Time**). |
| 2. **Ready questions for people.**     | Screening call: benefits, culture, company expectations. Interview: team, and technical specifics.                                                    |
| 3. **Apply to at least three places.** | One you don't want work at, and the rest you do. Practice with the "don't" place.                                                                     |
| 4. **Take notes.**                     | Write down notes during the all interview steps. You won't regret it, and then you'll have it to reference later.                                     |
| 5. **Research. Research. Research.**   | Understand the goals of each company. What their lines of business are, and consider would you fit in there.                                          |
| 6. **Never give a number first.**      | Goal: Verify you **want** to work here and if they **want** to hire you a lot. When that's true, numbers are flexible.                                |
| 7. **Listen and repeat.**              | Use keywords from the job posting, and use them where appropriate.                                                                                    |
| 8. **Money isn't everything.**         | It's important. Some places can't offer you what you need. Consider negotiating extra time off then.                                                  |
| 9. **"Interesting" is a great word.**  | Them: We can offer you 80k. You: 80k is interesting. It's not quite where we need this.                                                               |
| 10. **Defer to a EXTERNAL_AUTHORTY.**  | This gives you a scapegoat for refusing a request while not being guilty of the refusal yourself.                                                     |
