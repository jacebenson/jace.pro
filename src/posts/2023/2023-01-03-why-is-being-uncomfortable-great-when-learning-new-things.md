Ready to take the leap? Here's 7 Ways to Get Out of Your Comfort Zone:

1. Make a goal and work to achieve it.
2. Take a class in something you’re unfamiliar with.
3. Try a new sport or hobby.
4. Challenge yourself to do something you’ve never done before.
5. Volunteer for a cause outside your normal interests.
6. Take a risk and do something that scares you.
7. Step out of your usual routine and do something different.

Here are a few lessons I've learned the hard way that can help you on your journey. 

* Organizing meetups.  I ran the Minneapolis ServiceNow Developer Meetup for three years.  There I learned a **consistent schedule** and **great content** are essential to success. Don't fear reaching out to others for support.  By doing that people provided space, and content.  It wasn't always that way I had to make my fair share of labs.  
* Making videos. I made videos to discuss the happenings in the ServiceNow space.  Although I've been on hiatus for a hot minute, I'm coming back in January! I learned that **content is key**, and that you need to know how to **capture your viewers' attention**. I'm no expert, but I've come a long way since I started recording, editing, and posting videos.
* Blogging: This blog has been part of my life for years now, but when I first started it was a place for me to keep notes. Through content creation, I've learned (and am still learning!) **what success looks like**. Writing is a skill that improves the more you use it, so don't be afraid to write down your notes. Not everyone wants to make them public, and that's ok - make sure you write them down!
