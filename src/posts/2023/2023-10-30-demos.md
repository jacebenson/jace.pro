**Important**: As of version 2.0, the demos featured here are all directly built in the starter.

I did not want to clutter the starter with too many features, that you might not need, but I find myself using them frequently for my own projects, so now they are "baked in".
I will keep the old demo repos for the moment, but they are not maintained and are deprecated.

If you never saw version 1, nevermind.

## Demos

{% for item in demos %}

<article class="flow my-m-l">
   <h3>{{ item.title }}</h3>
   <p>{{ item.description }}
   <div class="cluster">
   <a class="button no-indicator" href="{{ item.preview }}">Demo</a>
   </div>
</article>
{% endfor %}
