**Update February 2024:**
The CSS system of this starter was invented by Andy Bell.
I wrote the following explanation quite quickly after hearing several times that people are confused about normal Tailwind CSS classes not working. In the meantime, Andy has published a [better and more detailed explanation](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-css-project-boilerplate/).

We are using Tailwinds "engine" to generate utility classes on demand, based on our design tokens.

If you have a look at the [tailwind.config.js](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent/blob/main/tailwind.config.js), you can see how that is done. For example, we are [deactivating Tailwinds default reset](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent/blob/main/tailwind.config.js#L72C1-L72C22).

We are hooking into the components layer, to make Tailwind output classes based on our tokens, instead of their default design system.

That is, you are able to use `mt-xs-s` instead of a class like `mt-20` for example. Same goes for colors, depending on the namesin your `colors.json`, you get custom classes like `text-pink`. These use the usual Tailwind prefixes ([see docs to learn how to generate colors](/get-started/#design-tokens)).

You get a custom property mapped to the color name `--color-my-custom-color-name` _and_ the classes `bg-my-custom-color-name` as well as `text-my-custom-color-name`.

Consider that we limit those utilities in the theme section:

```js
backgroundColor: ({theme}) => theme('colors'),
textColor: ({theme}) => theme('colors'),
margin: ({theme}) => ({ auto: 'auto', ...theme('spacing')}),
padding: ({theme}) => theme('spacing')
```

If you want to add the generation for `border-color` classes for example, you'd have to add that right there:

`borderColor: ({theme}) => theme('colors')`

Also. you _do_ have something like `md:text-right` available because we define the screens (`src/_data/designTokens/viewports.json`):

```js
screens: {
  ltsm: {max: `${viewportTokens.sm}px`},
  sm: `${viewportTokens.sm}px`,
  md: `${viewportTokens.md}px`,
  navigation: `${viewportTokens.navigation}px`
},
```

Additionally, you get custom properties based on the naming of your design token files:

```js
const groups = [
  {key: 'colors', prefix: 'color'},
  {key: 'borderRadius', prefix: 'border-radius'},
  {key: 'spacing', prefix: 'space'},
  {key: 'fontSize', prefix: 'size'},
  {key: 'lineHeight', prefix: 'leading'},
  {key: 'fontFamily', prefix: 'font'},
  {key: 'fontWeight', prefix: 'font'}
];
```

In your dev tools you can see all the generated custom properties + your custom ones from `css/global/variables.css`.
They are generated by default.

You can also create custom utility classes:

```js
const customUtilities = [
  {key: 'spacing', prefix: 'flow-space', property: '--flow-space'},
  {key: 'spacing', prefix: 'region-space', property: '--region-space'},
  {key: 'spacing', prefix: 'gutter', property: '--gutter'}
];
```

If you install the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense addon, you can actually see the classes available to you, including the color preview.
