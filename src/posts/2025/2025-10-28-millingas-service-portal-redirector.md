Sometimes you need to redirect users to an appropriate Service Portal based on various conditions. For example, you might want to redirect users based on their role, department, or location.

This usually requires dealing with ui scripts, the SPEntry script, and possibly other components. To simplify this process, Kevin Clark created the [Service Portal Redirector](https://github.com/milligna/sn-portal-redirector).

I haven't used it, however it's a tool and the developer is solid.  If you need to implement dynamic redirects in Service Portal, it's worth checking out.
