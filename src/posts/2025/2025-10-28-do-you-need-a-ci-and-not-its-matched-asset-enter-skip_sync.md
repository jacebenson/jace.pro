A few years ago I was digging into how Assets and CIs interact on ServiceNow.  I came across this article that explains the `skip_sync` field on Asset or CI records.

>
> For the latest information on this topic, see Configuration Item [cmdb_ci] class.
>
> The `skip_sync` field not only exists on assets but also on the CMDB table. It is the flag indicating whether synchronization between Asset and CMDB can be skipped.
>
> There are OOB script includes and business rules that may invoke according to functions and change the value of `skip_sync`:

> > Update Asset fields on change: /nav_to.do?uri=sys_script.do?sys_id=31e93aaf1b3210002502fbcd2c0713d8

> The `skip_sync` flag is used to prevent recursion within the same cycle of business rules and will be reset in the next cycle during Asset-CI synchronization. The `skip_sync` flag is set to false by default.
>
> As the two business rules above would be triggered twice during an Asset-CI synchronization. The `skip_sync` flag would be set to false again after the synchronization. In case the `skip_sync` flag was set to true for some reason, an update on the Asset/CI should help set the flag back to false.
