A new version is here! This includes a bunch of breaking changes.
Again I am changing the body font for this update, this time it's [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/).

## New Image handling

I have been clinging to my image shortcode for too long. With the [latest major version of Eleventy Image](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-img/releases/tag/v6.0.0) I decided it's finally time to also include the transform method, because it is awesome.

That alone would not be a breaking change, but I decided to change the existing Nunjucks image shortcode a bit. If you use the shortcode beyond the container class, you must adjust your code to these changes:

```js
( src,
  alt = '',
  caption = '',
  loading = 'lazy',
  containerClass,
  imageClass,
  widths = [650, 960, 1400],
  sizes = 'auto',
  formats = ['avif', 'webp', 'jpeg']
) => { ...
```

- **Breaking:** `widths` is now passed in _before_ `sizes` (because I change this value much more often).
- **Breaking:** `imageClass` is a new paramteter dedicated to the `<img>` element, while `containerClass` is for the container (`<figure>` or `<picture>`), as before.
- also new: for all images you can start the path relative to the input folder (drop `./src` in the path, though it is compatible with `./src` being present)

Using the transform comes with the great advantage, that you can now use co-located images with the HTML and Markdown sytnax. üéâ

## Cascade layers

[Inspired by Mayank's post](https://mayank.co/blog/css-reset-layer/), I‚Äôve transitioned to using [cascade layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Cascade_layers), instead of using the `:where()` pseudo-class to create low-specificity selectors for resets and compositions.

- The global CSS bundle is now organized with cascade layers.
- The local CSS bundle, used for per-page or component-specific styles, does not utilize cascade layers. As a result, all CSS blocks included have a higher specificity than global styles, regardless of the selector specificity in the global CSS bundle.

**Breaking:** The "inline" bundle is now called "local", as this made more sense: all bundles are inlined.

## New color system

Run `npm run colors` after defining your base color values in `src/_data/designTokens/colorsBase.json`. This will generate or update the `colors.json` file in the same directory.

- Colors under `shades_neutral` or `shades_vibrant` are converted into scalable palettes. This is not very elaborate, use a value more or less in the middle of the scale. Happy to receive suggestions for improvements.
- Colors listed under `standalone` and `light_dark` are left as they are, `light_dark` items output a second "subdued" version optimized for dark themes.

```json
// this creates a palette with shades of green, 100 to 900
{
  "shades_vibrant": [
    {
      "name": "green",
      "value": "#008000"
    }
  ]
}
```

`src/assets/css/global/base/variables.css` changed a lot, as I now use new color names. I also dropped the `@supports` blocks for `color-mix()` and the relative color syntax -- not because they aren't great, but I just perceived the whole file as too complex. Now JavaScript does the step of creating subdued colors for the dark theme.

I also considered using the new `light-dark()` CSS function instead of the repetitive code for `prefers-color-scheme` and `data-theme=‚Äúdark‚Äù`, but the browser support is still too low.

**Breaking:**: `src/assets/css/global/base/variables.css` changed. You must adapt your colors in `src/_data/designTokens/colorsBase.json` if you want to use the `npm run colors` script.

You can also just completely skip that and define your colors directly in `colors.json` (I recommend deleting the `colors` command in `package.json` in this case, so you don't unitentionally overwrite your work).

## New button styles

Inspired by [Andy's article](https://piccalil.li/blog/how-i-build-a-button-component/), the button styles changed. As the article explains that very well, I won't say much more about it.

## Other new features and changes

- `border-radius` became a design token used by the Tailwind config, to be set in `src/_data/designTokens/borderRadius.json`.
- new `3XS` spacing value in `src/_data/designTokens/spacing.json`.
- new `grid` composition layout `data-layout='thirds`.
- new OG images template. As it uses `meta.siteName` next to the 11ty Logo, you might have to adjust the template for that `src/common/og-images.njk`.

Let me know if you have any questions or issues with the update.
I am happy to help you out. Maybe you'll want to wait a bit, as I will add some more fixes, no doubt.
