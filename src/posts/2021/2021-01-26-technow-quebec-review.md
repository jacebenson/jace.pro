# Technow Quebec Review

The team presenting this noted that slides had a price tag indicating if something was effectively platform, or "extra". I'll denote this in the title with a ðŸ’² emoji.

This aired on Jan. 26th, and will be available in video sometime in March.

## UI Builder

* Lots of things in here, but just check theÂ [LCHH video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEb6-E0Xk1w)
