## Batched Update Sets

Wow. Save time by batching update sets in the same scope. Bring up from dev, and apply the batch instead of applying each update set in order, one at a time.

## Service Portal enhancements

[Release Notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/service-portal-rn.html)

### User Criteria

Before Jakarta you could lock portals, pages, widgets, and widget instances with a role and not User Criteria. Now you can.

### Lists widget have filter builder

Use the platform UI condition builder in the Data table from URL definition widget to create more complex table searches. The condition builder is disabled by default. Administrators can enable using the widget instance options for the Data table from URL definition widget.

### Contextual Search sources are not contextual

Narrow search results to specific sources by configuring the contextual search sources in the instance options of a search widget.

### A11y work "WCAG level AA"

Improvements to accessibility were made throughout the platform in congruence with WCAG 2.0 A standards. Improvements made specifically to Service Portal are listed here.

* High contrast theme: Changes the Service Portal ESM to be more accessible for users who have a hard time seeing low contrast colors.
* Screen reader title: Use the Edit Container background option in the context menu for to add a title that screen readers read aloud.
