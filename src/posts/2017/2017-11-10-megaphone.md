Megaphone is some hidden application ServiceNow made but didn't release.

This is not visible unless you change the module roles from `maint` to `admin`.

This uses the table, `sys_broadcast_message` and that creates a message as depicted in this [thread](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_question&sys_id=64cfcb65dbdcdbc01dcaf3231f9619f6&anchor=answer_7a0c6be1db181fc01dcaf3231f9619e7&view_source=searchResult).
