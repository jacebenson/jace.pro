This post is a extension of this [post](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=f10eaa2ddbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961925). Below I go over the videos, and the interactive site.

## Official Documentation

There's 2 places that have this;

* [Docs](https://docs.servicenow.com/)
* [Developer](https://developer.servicenow.com/)

## Foundations eLearning (videos)

The foundations course covers six modules. You will get an introduction and overview of how to interact with and navigate through this Foundations course. It also covers on how to navigate using filters and breadcrumbs and what you can see and do as a System Administrator.

Both of these end up on the same videos as listed in sub sections.

You can get your own instance to mess around from [developer.service-now.com](https://developer.service-now.com/). This is required for the Developer training courses.

## Prepare for the certification

| Cert | Description                     | Blueprint        |
|------|---------------------------------|------------------|
| CSA  | Certified System Administrator  | [Blueprint][CSA] |
| CAD  | Certified Application Developer | [Blueprint][CAD] |

ServiceNow has lots certifications now and they people interept them differently.  
Ultimately they show the following about the person

- They are willing to pay some money
- They are willing to take a class
- They are willing to take a test and pass
- They are willing to take a quiz each family release
- They are willing to pay a renewal fee every two years

`*` No Certification Documentation could be found, but it's listed as if one exists [on the Certification Guide](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/other-documents/training/tp-certification-guide.pdf).

## Taking the certification

Update \[July 1, 2018]: As of 7/1/2018, its stated you need to take the class before testing for the certification. The webassesor link still works and lists the classes for me.

ServiceNow uses onsite testing and at home testing. For the at home testing you'll need a detached webcam.

The cost is $150 per certification.

The CSA and CAD certification has a 90 minute time limit. The rest have a 130 minute time limit.
