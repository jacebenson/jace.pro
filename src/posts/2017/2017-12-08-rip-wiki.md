With all the announcements that ServiceNow is ending their Wiki, it makes me a little sad. I had once contributed to the pages before it locked down. With that being said, I learned a lot from the wiki. This was the second best resource next to the old joomla forum.

A lot of nights at my help desk job I remember visiting the "Recent Changes" to see new features that were made before they could get locked down. I found ServiceNow updates a little earlier than I should have because of this.

To get ready for this post I looked at the wayback machine to remember.

ServiceNow Wiki, you will be missed.

Take a look into the past
