This is the different team intake processes I've seen during my work with ServiceNow.

# Intake Process

## Light Agile

This process is in use by a team of three developers running two sprints on a two week span. Each member is rotated through the support sprint every third week.

### Heavy Agile Kanban Group

Product Owner sets importance of incoming work. Each lane or queue can have a predetermined number of items. When I was there were these four lanes:

* Ready
* Working
* User Acceptance Testing
* Ready for Release

This was to allow the Product Owner more flexibility to get work done outside the Scrum Process and to assist the Release Team.
