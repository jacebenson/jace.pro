Dev Toolbox is a scoped app to capture tests for all the Out of Box ServiceNow applications. This is a scoped application for Service-now to allow some utilities to be easily added and maintained on instances.

Now the difference between Jim's and mine is, well was, I haven't checked in a few months, about 11 features due to scoped things not being able to be added on a global level.
