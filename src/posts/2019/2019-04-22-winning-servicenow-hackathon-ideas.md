This year I'm fortunate enough to go to knowledge, and one of my favorite SN people, Robert Fedoruk, posted a [YouTube video about winning hackathons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctzX-ANG_Sk&feature=youtu.be).

In the spirit of sharing I'm adding a list I compiled after some searching to see what's won before as it wasn't aggregated anywhere I could see. I'd love to see these shared in an open way afterwards. If this makes the competition better, than that's great and my goal here. Below is that list.

In cases where patients need to be resuscitated, our emergency doctors and nurses face a high-stress and fast-moving environment where they need simple ways to track and document the actions they take in real-time - whether this is performing CPR, administering medication or taking notes and observations about a resuscitation event. As our hospitals are stretched and new staff brought on board to deal with the increased pressure caused by COVID-19, we need better ways to bring people up to speed with understanding the processes as quickly as possible. Historically many emergency wards have used pen and paper to document these resuscitation events, often needing to recreate the timeline of actions after the fact. Digitizing and simplifying these processes can help our Medical workers to focus more on caring for their patients, and less on maintaining paperwork. |

## 2021

> A mobile-friendly platform to attend virtual classes. A better way to stream interactive online events. A system that allows office employees to order and receive supplies from drones. These are among the best ideas to emerge from the Knowledge 2021 CreatorCon Hackathon, held May 8-9.\
> The hackathon serves as a forum for coders to design and display innovative apps on the Now Platform that can solve real business problems.\
> This year, more than 100 teams competed in the hackathon. ServiceNow judges for the event—including a vice president of platform product management, senior product managers, staff engineers, and developer advocates—selected four finalists and the Grand Prize winner, as well as five targeted award winners. The Grand Prize-winning team received Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality headsets and Bose Bluetooth headphones.

As colleagues hide behind their computer screens, they do not form close bonds with one another, which can lead to decreased motivation, worse results and low overall incentive. The introduction of Extended User Profile - highly customizable, interactive user profiles - can be a starting point towards better employee interactions, increased workplace visibility and company-wide initiatives. As a result, employees get to express themselves freely and proactively reach out to other colleagues that share their backgrounds and interests. Other functions include social media integration, visual effects, nicknames, and more. |

It enable users too have conversation in any respective language & translate all Audio & text conversation on the fly. This will help users to have cross border support without worrying about language as a barrier. For the current business use case we will be implementing this solution to the health care domain, where information and knowledge can be shared across borders in real time. Doctors and Researchers can create their ServiceNow pages using UI builder, then they will be able to schedule a web conference call, where ServiceNow Agents api can help them to translate their voice on the fly.”                  |
