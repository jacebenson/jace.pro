Understanding **when** something runs is critical when building these systems. ServiceNow has a very simple and great image that captures that for [business rules](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-servicenow-platform/page/script/business_rules/reference/r_HowBusinessRulesWork.html).\
However that doesn't help with other scripts in the system. Bas @ Logicalis wrote something up about this on\
[snc-blog](http://www.snc-blog.com/2017/02/02/script-execution-flow/) but I thought I could improve on it. Also messing with things is a way I\
remember better.

I try to keep all the common diagrams I use on [https://workflow.jace.pro/](https://workflow.jace.pro/?flow=BusinessRuleOrderSequence#) but I realize I don't really share when that changes.

Here I've been messing with this and I thought now is a great time to share this diagram I keep out there.
