I feel like this should be searchable and isn't today. So I am making a post to share that content.

There's a few things people should know to going fast. All the shortcuts, and accessing your stuff.

# [List Management](https://jace.pro/post/2019-10-06-faster-with-servicenow/#list-management)

## [Right-click](https://jace.pro/post/2019-10-06-faster-with-servicenow/#right-click)

Be bold and use your middle finger, to right-click on everything. This gives your access to the following actions;\
filter out

* show matching
* show before
* show after
* build a report

## [Use the monacle to search columns](https://jace.pro/post/2019-10-06-faster-with-servicenow/#use-the-monacle-to-search-columns)

This will load a textbox below each column, they work with text like so;

* `text` defaults to starts with
* `=text` is the exact match (case insensitive)
* `*text` is the text contains

## [Jump around with breadcrumbs](https://jace.pro/post/2019-10-06-faster-with-servicenow/#jump-around-with-breadcrumbs)

You can change your filter fast by smashing the different parts of the breadcrumbs.

* smash the chevron to remove the next specific filter
* smash the part of the filter to remove all the parts right of it

## [Editing data in a list](https://jace.pro/post/2019-10-06-faster-with-servicenow/#editing-data-in-a-list)

You don't have to go into each record to change the data.

* `CTRL` + smash and then double smash a cell to edit all selected rows for that column
* `SHIFT` + `↑` / `↓`, then double smash a selected cell to edit all selected rows

## [Control the data you see with the cog](https://jace.pro/post/2019-10-06-faster-with-servicenow/#control-the-data-you-see-with-the-cog)

* smash the cog to decide what columns you will see
* experiment with this as you can always reset

# [Accessing your stuff fast](https://jace.pro/post/2019-10-06-faster-with-servicenow/#accessing-your-stuff-fast)

* Drag a condition onto the left hand menu to add it to your favorites
* Ham sandwich menu has a create favorite option too that does the same from **list** and **record**
* Stars in the left hand menu appear if you hover, that will also add them to your favorites
* On the left hand menu in the star menu at the bottom is a pencil to edit all your favorites and their order
