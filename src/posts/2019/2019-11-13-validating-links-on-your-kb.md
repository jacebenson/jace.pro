The other day, "Jon" on slack asked;

> Hi everyone :slightly_smiling_face: We have a ton of external links in content items. How can I regularly check those links to make sure they are active?

Got me thinking, I should share this, cause someone might find it useful.

```json
{
  "https://google.com": ["KB1234","KB1235"],
  "https://ddg.gg": ["KB43232","KB4355"]
}
```

Then if the links are PUBLIC, you could just use a scripted rest message and if response is not 200 do  something, [https://jace.pro/post/2019-09-14-recordless-rest-is-great/\](https://jace.pro/post/2019-09-14-recordless-rest-is-great/%5C)

However if the links require auth or vpn access, you'll have to account for that.

I'd assume code would be something like;

```javascript
for(var link in links){
  doRestCall(link);
}
function doRestCall(url){
    var restMessage = new sn_ws.RESTMessageV2();
    restMessage.setHttpMethod("post");
    restMessage.setEndpoint(url);
    restMessage.setRequestBody(JSON.stringify({}));
    var response = restMessage.execute();
    if(response.getStatusCode()!=200){
      gs.error('not getting a 200 response');
    }
}
```

This could easily be adapted to a business rule or scheduled job to verify sites are available. One thing that would be interesting would be having this process check if the site is on the [Wayback machine](https://archive.org/web/web.php), if it is rewrite the link, if it is not, request it there and rewrite it to there.
