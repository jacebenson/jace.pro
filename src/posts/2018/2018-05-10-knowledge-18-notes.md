I was very lucky to get to go to Knowledge18 and before I leave I just want to write this down as to not forget it.

Of the labs, I attended I had no technical difficulty with the wifi or content. Others did, but somehow not me.

Below I'll go over the parts I think notable.

## [Things to keep in mind in general](https://jace.pro/post/2018-05-10-k18/#things-to-keep-in-mind-in-general)

* If there are repeating classes the later ones will be better but the speaker may have lost their voice
* Know the difference between the different types of events.

  * Breakouts are talks
  * Labs are step by step instruction with an instructor in the room to field questions and assist
  * Workshops are the same as labs but CreatorCon
* Look up the content of the event. If it's not a current feature, it's probably a new feature and might be a "this will be nice but you don't get it for two releases"
* Look up the presenters of the event. If it's a partner, be careful as it may be more of a success story of how some implementation or product they used was successful.

## [Registration](https://jace.pro/post/2018-05-10-k18/#registration)

Looks like they used [g2planet.com](http://g2planet.com/) which this year was pretty poor in my opinion. Hard to tell what you had already selected until you tried to add an event to the agenda

Suggestions to improve - Use what you used for 2016's registration or make your own.

## [Mobile App](https://jace.pro/post/2018-05-10-k18/#mobile-app)

This was terrible. I literally wrote my schedule down each day as it was more convenient to do that. Thankfully none of my classes moved after I arrived.

Suggestions to improve - Don't provide a mobile app. It would have been easier and then we'd been complaining about the website.

## [Social Stuff](https://jace.pro/post/2018-05-10-k18/#social-stuff)

This was great. With the way, my rep helped us get around and with all the folks.

## [Labs](https://jace.pro/post/2018-05-10-k18/#labs)

### [LAB1012 Manage Duplicate CIs Effortlessly to Keep Your CMDB Clean](https://jace.pro/post/2018-05-10-k18/#lab1012-manage-duplicate-cis-effortlessly-to-keep-your-cmdb-clean)

This was an awesome lab. It showed a new feature that lets you merge and handle the remaining duplicate ci's and their relationships in a very flexible way.

### [CCW0194 Advanced Identification Engine for Discovery](https://jace.pro/post/2018-05-10-k18/#ccw0194-advanced-identifcation-engine-for-discovery)

This really was all about using the horizontal patterns to discover configuration items which in my case would have been great three weeks prior as I had to self-teach myself it. It did confirm that I did learn this properly. There's a great youtube video where they show how to do most of this.

### [LAB0272 Discovery & Service Mapping in a Cloud First World - PaaS/IaaS](https://jace.pro/post/2018-05-10-k18/#lab0272-discovery-service-mapping-in-a-cloud-first-world-paasiaas)

Again this was a great session had I taken it three weeks prior. It did confirm I did learn the right topics and it focused on the Cloud Services Plugin v2.

### [LAB0299 Threat Hunting, Awareness and Sharing with Security Operations](https://jace.pro/post/2018-05-10-k18/#lab0299-threat-hunting-awareness-and-sharing-with-security-operations)

This was a nice overview of what the Secops application brings to ServiceNow. I thought of it to something akin to an overview of how GRC would work except you were guided along setting it up.

### [CCW1088 -- Service Portal: Advanced Widget Development](https://jace.pro/post/2018-05-10-k18/#ccw1088-service-portal-advanced-widget-development)

This lab was great in that I learned about the directives and how you can use them and share them across widgets. I also learned about a different way to have widgets communicate to each other than the broadcast and emitted events.
