# Integrate repeatably faster by following these steps

## Session Abstract

### Introduction and Problem Statement

My company is a company like others, with data in a lot of places. In this session, we'll look at how having a consistent integration policy can help make development of those integrations easier.

### Approach and Results

In this session, I will share how we've;

* Improved device tracking (azure intune) for compliance, and security reasons.
* SolarWinds import to improve discovery
* CrashPlan import to drive compliance of legal holds and status in a central system

### Attendees will learn how to

* Make a import set from a script
* Make import set rows from a script
* Run transform maps against a import set from a script

## What is the objective of your session?

To show, how and why using some consistent practices around integrations can save you a lot of time and trouble.

## What are the three key takeaways you will want your audience to leave with?

1. You can follow a common import pattern to drive most integrations to simplify development and further customizations
2. Rest API integrations that ServiceNow has to ask for data from can follow this pattern
3. After you do it once or twice you can do it for other integrations

# Open Sourcing ATF tests with Github and hacktoberfest

## Session Abstract

### Introduction and Problem Statement

My company is a company like others, we want to upgrade without delay but due to testing are slowed sometimes. In this session, we'll talk about how I started a repo to open source OOB Test Suites to give us a baseline for future upgrades.

### Approach and Results

In this session, I will share how I started to maintain a repo for test suites in ServiceNow. I found I was participating in my second #hacktoberfest and a thought occurred. How can I get other people to build tests so I don't have to? And it's simple. Make a repo, share it and spread the word.

## Attendees will learn how to

* Contribute to an open source project for scoped applications
* Avoid nuances for ServiceNow's repos branches
* Accept and Reject Pull Requests without breaking and losing data.
* Make a project site for the project with Netlify

## What is the objective of your session?

To show, how and why open sourcing some scoped applications can save you time.

## What are the three key takeaways you will want your audience to leave with?

1. You can open source scoped applications to share with the community work managed on git
2. Doing so can get other to contribute to help drive the progression of the project
3. It can help everyone, so, try to share in the future.

# Learn by supporting or starting your own local Developer Meetup

## Session Abstract

### Introduction and Problem Statement

Two years ago I started a Developer Meetup for ServiceNow talent to do ad-hoc labs and have happy hours. I didn't want what happened to the SNUG's happening to this event so I volunteered.

### Approach and Results

Running the event has been a ride and I would do it all over again. In this session I'll go over what it takes to run these events.

## Attendees will learn how to

* Identify how often and about what the meetup should meet about.
* Finding content to use for labs and / or for happy hour discussions.
* Finding hosting locations in your area.

## What is the objective of your session?

To share what it takes to run developer meetups to give attendees information to form their own OR assist their local meetup.

## What are the three key takeaways you will want your audience to leave with?

1. You don't have to host or run the event to help. There's lot's of opportunity to help out.
2. Attend it, it's smaller and less formal then your ServiceNow user groups.
3. Provide feedback, it's always useful.
