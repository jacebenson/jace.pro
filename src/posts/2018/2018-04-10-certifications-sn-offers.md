After hearing about how certifications are changing I read up on it some. I found the site confusing, so I made this post to put the useful thoughts together.

# [Certifications](https://jace.pro/post/2018-04-10-certifications/#certifications)

As of 7/1/2018 you're need to take a class to register for the exams¬†[according to this pdf Old version](https://jace.pro/post/2018-04-10-certifications/certifications-faq.pdf)¬†[SN FAQ](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/other-document/servicenow-certification-faq.pdf).

I was looking for a list of the certifications SN offers. As of today this is all I can find. Here's my sources;
