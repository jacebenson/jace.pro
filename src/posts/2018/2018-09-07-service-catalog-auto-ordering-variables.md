Today I learned a trick that would have saved me hours had I known about it years ago.

From time to time you find yourself working on a catalog item with variables. Sometimes those variables orders are to close together to allow for new variables. It would be great if you could press a button and have the order be fixed at 100s. You could write something custom... Or you could follow these steps;

1. Preview Item
2. Right-click header
3. Configure variables
4. Change the order of one variable
5. OK
6. Change the order back.

Now the variables are spaced in 100s
