This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.

Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length.

And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important. — Gary Provost

ServiceNow Discovery is a cloud-based IT service discovery and inventory management solution designed to help organizations identify, monitor, and manage their IT assets. It uses an automated process to detect, identify, and collect inventory data from a wide range of sources, including SNMP, ICMP, and Windows WMI, to provide comprehensive visibility into an organization’s IT infrastructure. This data can then be used to create and manage an inventory that can be used to track changes, identify trends, and proactively plan for future IT needs.
