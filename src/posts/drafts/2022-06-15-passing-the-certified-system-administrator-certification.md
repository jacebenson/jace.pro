This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.

Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length.

And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important. — Gary Provost

So I'm going to take her suggestion and run with this.  Thanks Isela!

## Preparing for the test

First thing I did was look up the [blueprint/exam specification](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/other-documents/training/servicenow-sys-admin-exam-specs.pdf).  Looking at the breakdown I identified where I think I might have problems.
