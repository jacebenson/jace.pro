[Brad Tilton released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTDa8nFRvmU) showing the nuances of how to add a Button to the list component on the experiences.  Running time is ~15 minutes.  Brad mentioned [Arnoud Kooi made a video about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8KDDHUvNO8), that runs for 11 minutes.  There's a lot going on here.  

Dhruv Gupta, Pranav, Earl and Chuck ran another [Let's Code Happy Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAxx2gQ56vE). This episode they are working on a Algo stock trading app.

* Sub-prods can be anonymized now
* Bulk update/delete feature
* IP Address field type
* Service Portal i18n improvement

[Benjamin Forrest is coming in weekly](https://www.linkedin.com/video/event/urn:li:ugcPost:6956791716175650817/) (this week Tuesday July 26 6pm CST) after training folks on ServiceNow to answer questions in office hours.  A great show with smart people

ServiceNow Impact? What is it, why.

* [Impact Product Negations by UpperEdge](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adam-mansfield_servicenow-impact-negotiations-key-contract-activity-6955228494238785538-OHeU?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web)
* [Interview with Aaron Fulkerson about what "ServiceNow Impact" is and what you get for it](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/an-introduction-to-impact/id1593700332) @3:30.  Ultimately I think this is driven from 

  * New Premium Support Offering
  * New Business Process and Technology experts that support the account and achieving their desired outcomes
  * Including training based on the value blueprint
  * New tools and technologies to manage customers in the ServiceNow environment
* I asked about it on Slack, and it seems it's like a extra tiered layer of support to get value from the investment made.  <https://www.servicenow.com/impact.html>  

[Pranav ports a cool login to the Service Portal from CodePen](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pranav-he-him-604802148_servicenow-servicenowdeveloper-activity-6956982468939849728-VHfL?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web)

CommitStrip made a comment about how no-code platforms can't perform some functions not called out when originally scoped.  It feels very appropriate on ServiceNow.
