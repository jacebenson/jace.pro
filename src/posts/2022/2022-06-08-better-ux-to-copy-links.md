Copying links in ServiceNow isn't terrible but it could be better.  

Casey B. must have felt that way too because he made it better.

This share item, [Copy Quick Link](https://developer.servicenow.com/connect.do#!/share/contents/3931356_copy_quick_link?v=1.0&t=PRODUCT_DETAILS), adds a UI Action on the task table to copy a more descriptive link to the current item.

I made a video going over this too, check it out.
