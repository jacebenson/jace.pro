A lot of markdown packages are installed to help you write your posts.
You can configure them in `config/plugins/markdown.js`.

As of my personal preference, there are some presets. For example the conversion of web pages to links (www.lenesaile.com) and the addition of `rel="noopener"` for external links (all links with the pattern `/^https?:/`).

**This is a tiny pitfall!**
Take care to not prefix your internal links with your domain, or else they will be treated as external. To link internally, use this pattern:

```markdown
An internal link to the [about page](/about/)
```
