# Implementing Chargebacks

## Start with speaking

Talk in terms that you're providing these forms, and customizations at your business's cost but talk about things in a way to be clear, there is a cost.

E.g.

> We will customize that form, it will take \~ x points or \~ x hours.\
> Today we don't charge other units for this work.\
> In time these requests will need to provide a return of investment greator than the cost of development

## Start with showback

Once you start talking that way, determine what the cost actually is.\
Identify Rate of pay per hour or per point based on average of staff or some arbitrary number

Use estimated points/hours to show estimated cost, use actual points/hours to actual cost.

Continue to provide work even if it's at a loss during this time.

## Implement Chargeback

Now that this work has been shown to have cost and what a return on investment would be.\
Start using that data.
