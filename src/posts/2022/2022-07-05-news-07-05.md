* Getting an offer from a job is great.  Being able to negotiate that salary is something I still struggle with.  Andrea South shared that she got an offer but wasn't thrilled with offer.  She asked "How would you negotiate the salary?"  Robert Fedoruk and Joesph Laudon piped up with some great knowledge. 

> 1. You have to be willing to walk away.
> 2. Make your response short, sweet and to the point. 
> 3. Say what you want and decide for yourself where your hard line is.

Written.

* I’ve been in a few situations where I wanted to anonymize data in a table. I can imagine many scenarios where you have personal identification information you need to keep secure in lower environments this person just made some [Servicenow Table data anonymizer](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_article&sys_id=8f1491481bac5950a59033f2cd4bcb9c) I haven’t had time to check it out but it’s on a list for me to get to.

* There’s some great ways to keep your catalog items from having extra unneeded stuff [Nia McCash writes about a few Instance Scan](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_article&sys_id=ccf465ba1bd81510b4b577bc1d4bcb26) checks you can build to help.
* Speaking of instance scans. Have you heard of the [instance troubleshooter application](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_article&sys_id=9e1bf1bd1b189510c552c8031d4bcb11)? I hadn’t. Kopal does a great review.

Audio

* I really enjoy Dhruv and Ashutosh’s podcast. This week they had Nerys on. Turns out she’s one of their bosses. It’s great to hear folks and their different pasts and how they come up. Have you ever interviewed your boss publicly like this? If so I’d love to check it out. Share a link in the doobly doo. [Laten We Praten Nerys Mutlow](https://audio.buzzsprout.com/pgcwody2b6kocv39fupz82ayi8wm?response-content-disposition=inline&)
* I was asked to talk about [side projects on Break Point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh35wt4w8vY). I really think they are crucial to solidly learning concepts and new tech. What side projects are you working on?
* Speaking of breakpoint I finally got some time to [listen to Tracy Miller and she talks about the nextgen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNJtWoXaSKM) bootcamp they are running and I don’t often reach out to folks to thank them but I did to Tracy. It’s an amazing program and I’m inspired every time I see progress by the groups they are running.
* Chuck and the Duke give their two cents on [What the hec is a ServiceNow Admin](https://share.transistor.fm/s/c307e8ac)?

Video

* Earl had been making some fun short form stuff on TikTok. I enjoy this content a lot - [The two states of all deverlopers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0MnXbOAbko)
* Barry O’Sulliven plays golf most Friday afternoons. He does this cause Crossfuze makes Friday afternoons free for employees to take off. That sounds awesome. I remember when I worked at Expedia we had some amazing travel benefits and were also considered a “travel agent”. What benefits have you seen that are like those two?

* Hey who’s that. How did you get in here. Never mind I’m glad to have you what’s new chuck. [SN Utils with Arnoud Kooi - Did You Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJzT3HGTHXQ)
* Measurable value is so important. I made a video recently about using metrics in scopes where I emphasized that. Then I found this talk between Harry Tillman and Lombardo about generating revenue. [GlideChat E26](https://youtu.be/VOPACeMO8R0)

Other stuff

* [Fedoruk continues go with the flow series](<* https://youtu.be/aD3htEQUhxM>)
* MyTechBestFriend sent out acceptance letter this week and the hope and eagerness this class shows is amazing
* Nextgen the skills bridge cohort just finished up. There’s new folks popping up on LinkedIn and I’m on it. You should reach out too.
* ServiceNow received a user experience award. This I the first year of it in the us. I’m not sure how fierce the competition was but ServiceNow won it. I know theirs parts of platform that need help but a lot of it is really great with WCAG 2 or 3 compliance.
* Hardik shared that ServiceNow's cloud connectors include a plug-in for oracles cloud. More providers is always a great thing.
* Chris walker shares stuff about [MITRE ATT&CK](<* https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christopher-walker-771a2666_secbytes-s2e2-mitre-attck-with-servicenow-activity-6946135393884934145-3kdX?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=ios_app>) in a great video
* [ServiceNow received a Silver Stevie award](<* https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jrpoisson_happy-to-share-that-servicenow-has-been-named-activity-6942833021309915136-d6Wj?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=ios_app>) which I had to look up what they meant. Sounds like they were initially set up to tell the good guys from the bad ones. I suppose that’s subjective. But it’s nice to get an award.
