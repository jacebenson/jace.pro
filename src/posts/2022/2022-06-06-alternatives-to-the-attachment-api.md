Storage in ServiceNow is expensive.  Because of that, I'd encourage you to AVOID this for your work's budget.  That being said, if you find you need to upload attachments programtically, this post might be helpful as these ways aren't clearly defined in the other sources.

There's three ways to upload attachments to ServiceNow.

### REST Attachment API

The [Attachment API](https://docs.servicenow.com/search?q=attachment%20api) is probably the one most will use.  It works generally how you would expect, you can get the file content, meta data, post a new file, delete a file.  One thing to note.  When creating a file you must have a valid table and sys_id that will have the file.

### Web Services (soap)

This is not recommended, ServiceNow recommends the REST Attachment API.

Like the REST Attachment API, this also says it requires a table and sys_id albeit, but that isn't true.  So you can attach things to random places like how catalog item attachments get created.

### Related Uploads

Sometimes you don't only want to upload a file but you also want to tranform the data in the file.  There's a special endpoint to handle that as Josh Nerius wrote a few years ago;
