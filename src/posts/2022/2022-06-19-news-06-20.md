4. Pop-up experiences are a thing now.  Looks like a [ServiceNow County Fair](<1. https://360magazine.com/2022/06/15/servicenow-innovation-park-experience/>) to show and demo ServiceNow in person it happened in 10 cities.  I don't know when is but it's happening.  If you know more I would love to hear from you.

5. ServiceNow just released [Azimuth](https://servicenow.github.io/azimuth/main/), a open source utility to better understand AI datasets and model predictions.  I don't know much about that stuff, but it's rare to see ServiceNow do this.

* [Techbridge hones Daronja Smith's interview skills.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daronjasmith_interview-servicenow-tips-activity-6943533921603112960-kh6i?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web)
* Here's the things Daronja always found useful when interviewing:

  1. Try to incorporate a fun fact about yourself, this a good way to eliminate the pressure.
  2. Think of the interview as a conversation, instead of an interrogation.
  3. Ask questions! This is a time for you to learn as much as you can about the company and their values, to ensure they align with your own.
