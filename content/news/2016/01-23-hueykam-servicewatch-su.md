<p>The ServiceWatch product is finally integrated with the ServiceNow platform from Geneva release! If you are not using the latest Geneva release of ServiceNow, you will be missing out on the powerful synergy of the ServiceWatch suite. The original ServiceWatch functionality is divided into two different plugins from Geneva release.</p><p></p><p>The two paid plugins from Geneva release onwards are as follows:</p><ol><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/product/service_mapping/concept/c_GetStartedWithServiceMapping.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/service_mapping/concept/c_GetStartedWithServiceMapping.html">Service Mapping</a> (com.snc.service-mapping)<span style="color: #eb7a3d;"><br/></span></li><li><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/product/event_management/concept/c_EMGetStarted.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/event_management/concept/c_EMGetStarted.html">Event Management</a> (com.glideapp.itom.snac)</li></ol><p></p><p>The plugins are available depending on which ServiceWatch solution package is suitable for your organization. For more information about the package offerings, please get in touch with your account manager and consultant to find out more information about them.</p><p><img alt="itom-diagram.jpg.imgo.jpg" class="image-1 jive-image" src="http://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/images/solutions-asset/images/itom-diagram.jpg.imgo.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 372px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p>Starting with Geneva release, the new ServiceNow product documentation also has a wealth of information and some step-by-step examples about <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/service_mapping/concept/c_ServiceMappingOverview.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/service_mapping/concept/c_ServiceMappingOverview.html">Service Mapping</a> and <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/event_management/concept/c_EM.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/event_management/concept/c_EM.html">Event Management</a>.</p><p></p><p><span style="; text-decoration: underline; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Difference between traditional ServiceNow Discovery and Service Mapping</strong></span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The traditional ServiceNow Discovery is now known as horizontal discovery, the Service Mapping discovery is also known as </span>vertical<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> discovery. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Service Mapping discovery uses the information discovered by the horizontal discovery. Using patterns, the Service Mapping discovery cleverly </span>identifies related dependent services and recursively discovers them.</p><p></p><p>The end product of the Service Mapping discovery is a brand new <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/business_service_management_map_ng/concept/c_BusinesssServiceManagementMaps.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/business_service_management_map_ng/concept/c_BusinesssServiceManagementMaps.html">Dependency Views</a> map.</p><p>This new Dependency Views map contains more information than the <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/business_service_management_map_legacy/reference/r_BusinessServiceManagementMap.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/business_service_management_map_legacy/reference/r_BusinessServiceManagementMap.html">Legacy Business Service Management Map</a>. The new Dependency View graphically displays the dependency relationships between the configuration items for the related business service.</p><p></p><p><img alt="service-mapping-screenshot.png.imgo.png" class="image-2 jive-image" src="http://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/images/products-asset/images/service-mapping-screenshot.png.imgo.png" style="width: 620px; height: 430px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/product/service_mapping/concept/c_UndestandMaps.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/service_mapping/concept/c_UndestandMaps.html">Service Mapping (Dependency View / Business Service Map)</a></span></p><p></p><p></p><p>You can get the basics of Service Mapping, how to troubleshooting Service Mapping, and the advanced features in the plugin by watching the video playlist.</p><p></p><center><p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgkWE8z3mxM?list=PLCOmiTb5WX3qfGWUAC9oG91XFX-K-8wvH" width="560">

The first of my favorite things in Service Mapping is Interactive Pattern Testing and Debugging. This is a cool feature for   <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/product/service_mapping/task/t_PatternExamplePatDef.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/service_mapping/task/t_PatternExamplePatDef.html">creating a pattern</a>, modifying a pattern or debugging a pattern. The debug feature does an interactive call to the machine and returns the result to you; however, you have to be patient when you use this feature because the call has to go through a MID Server to reach your internal network. My second favorite part of Service Mapping is the history time line which makes scrolling or <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/product/service_mapping/task/t_ViewCIChanges.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/service_mapping/task/t_ViewCIChanges.html">comparing history</a> much easier.</p><p><img   alt="service watch mapping.jpg" class="image-6 jive-image" src="3c246dcedbdc13043eb27a9e0f961939.iix" style="width: 620px; height: 549px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/service_mapping/task/t_CompareBS.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/service_mapping/task/t_CompareBS.html">Compare two versions of a business service</a></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Event Management in ServiceWatch</h2><p>Starting from Geneva, when you have the new Event Management plugin, you will have a colorful dashboard which shows you the health of your services. This dashboard allows for easier and more efficient event collection.</p><p></p><p><img alt="service-health-dash.png.imgo.png" class="image-5 jive-image" src="http://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/images/products-asset/images/service-health-dash.png.imgo.png" style="width: 620px; height: 430px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p><p></p><p>There are a few basic <a title="ocs.servicenow.com/product/event_management/concept/c_EMEventCollection.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/event_management/concept/c_EMEventCollection.html">event collection</a> options. There are a few out-of-box groovy scripts that enable the MID Server to connect to external servers to obtain event information. <a title="" _jive_internal="true" href="/community/operations-management/discovery/blog/2015/09/30/overview-of-mid-server-orchestration">The MID Server</a> can also process SNMP traps as events. Alternatively, you can also easily create some scripts to do the event collection via scripts.</p><p></p><p>For more integration information:</p><p><a title="w.servicenow.com/solutions/it-operations-management.html" href="http://www.servicenow.com/solutions/it-operations-management.html">http://www.servicenow.com/solutions/it-operations-management.html</a><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/product/event_management/concept/c_EMIntegrationEvent.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/event_management/concept/c_EMIntegrationEvent.html" style="line-height: 1.5;">Event collection via script (Integration notes)</a></p><p><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/product/event_management/task/t_EMSNMPTrapEvent.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/event_management/task/t_EMSNMPTrapEvent.html">Event collection via SNMP traps (Integration notes)</a></p><p><a title="ocs.servicenow.com/product/event_management/task/t_EMConfigureEmailConnector.html" href="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/event_management/task/t_EMConfigureEmailConnector.html">Event collection via Email (Integration notes)</a></p><p></p><h4>Why ServiceWatch Suite</h4><p>The <a href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/service-mapping.html" title="http://www.servicenow.com/products/service-mapping.html">Service Mapping</a> and <a href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/orchestration/event-management.html" title="http://www.servicenow.com/products/orchestration/event-management.html">Event Management</a> are the basic foundation to a bigger system. With the ServiceWatch Suite, it also includes <a href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/orchestration.html" title="http://www.servicenow.com/products/orchestration.html">Orchestration</a> and <a href="http://www.servicenow.com/products/orchestration/cloud-management.html" title="http://www.servicenow.com/products/orchestration/cloud-management.html">Cloud Management</a>. Part of the Alert Management under the Event Management offering is the <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/event_management/reference/r_SAAlertandCIRemediation.html" title="https://docs.servicenow.com/product/event_management/reference/r_SAAlertandCIRemediation.html">Alert and CI remediation</a>. What this means is that you can construct a workflow to do something in response to an alert from   Event Management. You can design the system to do almost anything from creating an incident task, to send out email and/or restart the server. This is a powerful offering which every organization should aspire to have.</p><p></p><p>Similar to any implementation and integrations, the initial setup is the most challenging because of the uniqueness of your business services in your organization. To make it easier, I would suggest 3 things: have an experienced team, have MID Server resources, be realistic about speed of execution. For Service Mapping discovery, not only does the person/team need to know about the ServiceNow and Service Mapping, it is also necessary to have good knowledge of the system and application it is discovering. The Service Mapping comes with a good database of patterns of applications. During initial setup, if there are any issues with discovery, some inexperience developer or integration team struggle to figure out what goes wrong. Hence it is better to engage an experienced team (e.g., ServiceNow Professional Service team) to do the implementations. During Service Mapping discovery, there will be a lot of transactions and processing at the MID Server. I will suggest that a separate set of MID Servers to be dedicated to the Service Mapping jobs. It is advisable to give these MID Server more memory and CPU. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Since the execution of the discovery is done at the MID Server, it may take a while for the discovery to complete. At times, it may appear that the discovery hangs but you can easily check the ECC queue and the logs at the MID Server to make sure it is still running.</span></p><p></p><p>There is so much to talk about ServiceWatch Suite (Service Mapping and Event Management), we can spend the whole week talking about it.
