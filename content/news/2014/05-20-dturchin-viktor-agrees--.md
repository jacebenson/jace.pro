To fund his trip he rented his 10-speed on <a href="https://www.spinlister.com/"><span>Spinlister</span></a> to a neighbor for the week then walked a colleague's dog with the help of <a href="https://www.taskrabbit.com/"><span>TaskRabbit</span></a> while she was on business travel.</span></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><span>In-the-know Creators have only one place to go: <a href="https://share.servicenow.com/app.do#/home/false"><span>ServiceNow</span> Share</a>. We launched it at Knowledge14 and within 24 hours legions of new Creators started downloading地nd uploading地nd rating地nd commenting地nd thanking us for saving them weeks of effort. Call it an upgrade from buggy to <span>Bugatti</span>. A promotion from mail room to board room.</span></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><span>We see amazing ideas, <span>apps</span>, scripts, <span>workflows</span>, and probes every day. We launched Share to make sure you do too. Share isn't a technology breakthrough but it does demonstrate our commitment to investing in Creator Nation. There's nothing hollow about our promise to make it easier to create in <span>ServiceNow</span> than it is to manage requests in email, spreadsheets, or tired <span>SharePoint</span> sites.</span></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><span>With innovations like <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Visual_Task_Boards" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Visual_Task_Boards">Visual Task Boards</a> (sticky notes for <span>geeks</span>), the <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Service_Creator" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Service_Creator">Service Creator</a> (<span>apps</span> by soccer moms), and the <a title="iki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Using_Forms" href="https://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Using_Forms">form designer</a> (web forms for <span>technophobes</span>) in our <a title="ki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Eureka_Release_Notes" href="http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Eureka_Release_Notes">Eureka release</a>, it will be easier to take ideas from concept to launch in <span>ServiceNow</span> than in any other authoring environment - including whiteboards and sticky notes.</span></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">Share is free, available now, and has or will soon have that thing your boss asked you to create that made you curl up in fetal position. And if it doesn't, use the Community to find others with the same requirement then divvy up the work and publish it. Most important, let us know what else you want from Share. We're hard at work on many other ways to make it easier to deliver more, higher quality projects in less time.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><span>Right on <span>Viktor</span>. You inspired us. Just don't ask me to rent your 10-speed.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
