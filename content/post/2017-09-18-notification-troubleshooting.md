lot to make them work.

# Notification Troubleshooting

Check these things.

1.  On the notification, verify the notification table is correct.

## Weight

> Set a numerical value for the notification priority relative to other
> notifications with the same target table and recipients. The system
> only sends the notification with the highest weight. All other
> notifications are moved from the Outbox to the Skipped mailbox. The
> default value 0 causes the system to always send the notification
> (assuming the conditions are met).
>
> For example, suppose that a service desk agent adds a comment to an
> incident and shortly thereafter closes it. By default, these actions
> trigger both the Incident commented and Incident Closed notifications.
>
> However, both notifications are from the Incident table and also
> notify the incident caller. The system only sends the notification
> with the highest weight, which in this case is the Incident Closed
> notification.
>
> Determine whether any of the troubleshooting steps below are true for
> your environment. Each step provides a link to an article that will
> help you eliminate possible causes and take corrective action as
> necessary.
