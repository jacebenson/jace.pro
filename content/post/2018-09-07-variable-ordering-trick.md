title: Variable Ordering Trick

Today I learned a trick that would have saved me hours had I known about
it years ago.

From time to time you find yourself working on a catalog item with many
variables. Sometimes those variables orders are to close together to
allow for new things. It would be great if you just press a button and
have the order be fixed at 100s. You could write something custom... Or
you could just follow these steps;

1.  Preview Item
2.  Right-click header
3.  Configure variables
4.  Change the order of one variable
5.  OK
6.  Change the order back.

Now the variables are spaced in 100s
