Restarting a workflow is sometimes needed. I found myself looking at how
to to do this today.

I'm posting this so I don't have to re-do this again.

There are 2 ways to restart workflows.

1.  No code.

-   Delete the workflow context record. I do this by going to the record
    in question. E.g. `/sc_req_item.do?sysparm_query=number=RITM0012345`
-   Click into the "Show Workflow Context" UI Action Link (above the
    related lists)
-   Click Delete on the top right of the workflow context record !!! BE
    SURE YOU'RE ON THE WF\_CONTEXT !!!
-   Goto the RITM and update the stage to `request_approved`
-   That's it.

2.  With Code.

-   Delete the workflow context record. I do this by going to the record
    in question. E.g. `/sc_req_item.do?sysparm_query=number=RITM0012345`
-   Click into the "Show Workflow Context" UI Action Link (above the
    related lists)
-   Click Delete on the top right of the workflow context record !!! BE
    SURE YOU'RE ON THE WF\_CONTEXT !!!
-   Goto the `wf_workflow.list` table and find the workflow you want to
    start, copy it's `sys_id`.
-   Run this script in a background script;

``` {.js}
  var current = new GlideRecord('sc_req_item');
  current.get('number','RITM0012345');
  var id = 'cfe7a62f13958340f415345fd144b075';//wf_workflow sys_id here
  var w = new Workflow();
  var context = w.startFlow(id, current, current.operation(), function(){
      var vars = {};
      for (var n in current.variables) 
          vars[n] = current.variables[n];
      return vars;
  });
```
