This is just a list of things I think the ATF Tests should include.

I think every test should have the following steps;

-   Create users to use to for test (Server\>Insert Record on sys\_user)
-   Create role(s) for the newly created user, as you may not always
    know a good user to test as.(Server\>Insert Record on
    sys\_user\_has\_role)
-   Impersonate the user(Server\>Impersonate)
-   Use Server\>Record Validation to test most field values
-   Use Form validation for User Experience testing.

Tests should also follow these as well

-   Track Tests in update set with the code
-   Group Tests by tag. Â Tag for Application, Testing Schedule, and
    Feature/Effort/Sprint
-   Tests should be small units to test and not dependent on eachother.
-   Tests should be part of the estimate of work when sizing work.
-   Tests should run on a schedule.
