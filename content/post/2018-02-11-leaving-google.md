So I read this AMA and one
[post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7tnnv9/its_data_privacy_day_2018_im_the_founder_ceo_of/#dtdurz1)
really struck a cord with me. After deciding yep I'm leaving I did some
searching and found this Youtuber, [Hex
DSL](https://youtu.be/C2mXhn8u3ng?t=103), where he goes over his
services and what he's been switching from. I found this really useful
to compare where I was in terms of what I need to do.

So below is the table of things I use and what I'm changing.

| Current Service  | Alternative        | Switched | Comments                                       |
|------------------|--------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| Gmail            | Protonmail         | Done     | Some places don't let you change your email.   |
| Google Drive     | Amazon Drive       | Done     | I have a lot of files :(                       |
| Google Contacts  | Protonmail         | Done     | This was easy with CardDAV protocol            |
| Google Calendar  | Hotmail's Calendar | Done     | This was easy with CalDAV protocol             |
| Google Search    | Duckduckgo         | Done     | This is easy to change.                        |
| Google Photos    | Amazon Photos      | Done     | Grouping this with the Google Drive -\> Amazon |
| Google Analytics | Clicky             | Done     |                                                |
