Here's my take of whats new with Jakarta

# Jakarta

-   In the left hand search field, `table.config` has been added.
-   In journaled fields, now videos are added like image files in the
    activity formatters.
-   Export to JSON is new and neat.
-   [Global search](/search-api) is different

## Batched Update Sets

This is HUGE. Save time by batching update sets in the same scope. Bring
up from dev, and apply the batch instead of applying each update set in
order, one at a time.

## Service Portal enchancements

### User Criteria

Prior to Jakarta you could lock portals, pages, widgets, and widget
instances with a role and not User Criteria. Now you can.

### Lists widget have fitler builder

Use the platform UI condition builder in the Data table from URL
definition widget to create more complex table searches. The condition
builder is disabled by default. Administrators can enable using the
widget instance options for the Data table from URL definition widget.

### Contextual Search sources are not contextual

Narrow search results to specific sources by configuring the contextual
search sources in the instance options of a search widget.

### A11y work "WCAG level AA"

Improvements to accessibility were made throughout the platform in
congruence with WCAG 2.0 A standards. Improvements made specifically to
Service Portal are listed here.

-   High contrast theme: Changes the Service Portal ESM to be more
    accessible for users who have a hard time seeing low contrast
    colors.
-   Screen reader title: Use the Edit Container background option in the
    context menu for to add a title that screen readers read aloud.
