I was very lucky to get to go to Knowledge18 and before I leave I just
want to write this down as to not forget it.

Of the labs, I attended I had no technical difficulty with the wifi or
content. Others did, but somehow not me.

Below I'll go over the parts I think notable.

## Things to keep in mind in general

-   If there are repeating classes the later ones will be better but the
    speaker may have lost their voice
-   Know the difference between the different types of events.
    -   Breakouts are just talks
    -   Labs are step by step instruction with an instructor in the room
        to field questions and assist
    -   Workshops are the same as labs but CreatorCon
-   Look up the content of the event. If it's not a current feature,
    it's likely a new feature and might be a "this will be nice but you
    don't get it for two releases"
-   Look up the presenters of the event. If it's a partner, be careful
    as it may be more of a success story of how some implementation or
    product they used was successful.

## Registration

Looks like they used g2planet.com which this year was pretty poor in my
opinion. Hard to tell what you had already selected until you tried to
add an event to the agenda

Suggestions to improve - Use what you used for 2016's registration or
make your own.

## Mobile App

This was terrible. I literally wrote my schedule down each day as it was
more convenient to do that. Thankfully none of my classes moved after I
arrived.

Suggestions to improve - Don't provide a mobile app. It would have been
easier and then we'd just be complaining about the website.

## Social Stuff

This was great. With the way, my rep helped us get around and with all
the folks I saw and know it was awesome.

## Labs

### LAB1012 Manage Duplicate CIs Effortlessly to Keep Your CMDB Clean

This was a really awesome lab. It showed a new feature that lets you
merge and handle the remaining duplicate ci's and their relationships in
a very flexible way.

### CCW0194 Advanced Identifcation Engine for Discovery

This really was all about using the horizontal patterns to discover
things which in my case would have been great three weeks prior as I had
to self-teach myself it. It did confirm that I did learn this correctly.
There's a great youtube video where they show how to do most of this
stuff there.

### LAB0272 Discovery & Service Mapping in a Cloud First World - PaaS/IaaS

Again this was a really great session had I taken it three weeks prior.
It did confirm I did learn the right things and it focused on the Cloud
Services Plugin v2.

### LAB0299 Threat Hunting, Awareness and Sharing with Security Operations

This was a nice overview of what the Secops application brings to
ServiceNow. I thought of it to something similar to an overview of how
GRC would work except you were guided along setting it up.

### CCW1088 -- Service Portal: Advanced Widget Development

This lab was great in that I learned about the directives and how you
can use them and share them across widgets. I also learned about a
different way to have widgets communicate to each other than the
broadcast and emitted events.
