title: Update Set Naming
authors: ["jace"]

Update set names should be somewhat meaningful without having to look at
the contents of the XML.\
ServiceNow has some recomendations on
[HI](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0552854)
and on the
[Docs](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-application-development/page/build/system-update-sets/reference/get-started-update-sets.html)
site.

With that being said, generally best to have initials, date, some key
(task) or description.

# Update Set Naming Convention

-   Make the names meaningful to the task at hand. The update set name
    should consist of the following.
    -   Related task record, version, release or sprint number
    -   Brief description
    -   Developer's initials
-   For example, if working on Incident Management form layout from a
    Story. The update set name could be
    `STRY00123_Incident Mgmt Form Layout_ABC`
    -   Update Set Description
-   Put in as much detail as needed to ensure that if another member of
    the team looks at the update set record they can see what the
    contents are.
-   This becomes especially important when working on an entire track.
    If you are working on Incident Management as a whole with multiple
    stories assigned to you, you should list all related stories in the
    description of the update set record.
-   The update set name should consist of the following if working on an
    entire track:
    -   Date, version, release or sprint number
    -   Brief description
    -   Developer's initials
    -   Example: `JB-2018-09-20 Combine both inc record producers`

We added some javascript to prefill the initials, and date for
consistency on the name field. Below makes the following output;
`JB-2018-09-20`

``` {.js}
javascript: (function(){
  var r = '';
  var u = gs.getUser();
  r += (u.getFirstName()+'')[0];
  r += (u.getLastName()+'')[0];
  r += '-';
  var d = new GlideDateTime();
  var ms = d.getNumericValue();
  r += new Date(ms).toISOString().split('T')[0];
  r += ' ';return r;}
  )()
```
