### Heavy Agile Kanban Group

Product Owner sets importance of incoming work.  Each lane or queue can only have a predetermined number of items. When I was there it was four.  Lanes were as follows;

- Ready
- Working
- User Acceptance Testing
- Ready for Release

This was to allow the Product Owner more flexibility to get things done outside the Scrum Process and to assist the Release Team.
