This is just the different team intake processes I've seen during my
work with Servicenow.

# Intake Process

## Light Agile

This process is in use by a team of three developers running two sprints
on a two week span. Each member is rotated through the support sprint
every third week.

### Heavy Agile Kanban Group

Product Owner sets importance of incoming work. Each lane or queue can
only have a predetermined number of items. When I was there it was four.
Lanes were as follows;

-   Ready
-   Working
-   User Acceptance Testing
-   Ready for Release

This was to allow the Product Owner more flexibility to get things done
outside the Scrum Process and to assist the Release Team.
