This is a extensive list of questions for both interviewers and
interviewees when Servicenow Development is involved.

# Interview Preperation

So interviewing is exciting.  It's a way to get uncomfortable and see
what is available in jobland.  Something to keep in mind, interviews are
a way for you and your employer to find a great fit for this position. 
The employer may be happy to have you, but you may not be happy in that
position, so it's crucial to get information from the interview to tell
you about the technology, team, and the expectations they'll have.  The
expectations should have been set on the job posting, but it's good to
ask specifics about any you question. With that being said, when the
technical questions are being asked, you should be able to see they
understand the question and answer.

Interviews... So you want to interview for a job as a Servicenow
Developer.
