Surveys are great, if they make them concise and to the point.

## What Makes a Great Survey

### Keep it short, stupid

Your biggest concern is being **clear and concise**, or in finding the
shortest way to ask a question without muddying its intent. It's not
just about reducing the character count; you must **eliminate
superfluous phrasing** from your questions.

**Survey length remains important** for keeping abandon rates low. Think
about the last time you sat around and excitedly answered a 10-minute
survey. Not likely.

### Ask only questions that fulfill your end goal

You need to be ruthless when it comes to cutting unnecessary questions
from your surveys.

Ask this question about every question you include, "Does this question
drive action once recieved?" If the answer is no, why are you asking it?
The action doesn't have to get you calling the surveyee, but should
drive trends to changes you want to make.

### Construct smart, open-ended questions

Some of your most insightful feedback will come from open-ended
questions. However, nothing makes a survey more intimidating than a huge
text box connected to the very first question. It's best to take on
brief questions first to create a sense of progress, and then give
survey takers who've made it to the closing questions the opportunity to
elaborate on their thoughts.

One strategy is to get people to commit to a question with a simple
introduction, and then follow up with an open-ended question such as,
"Why do you feel this way?"

### Ask one question at a time

We've all been hit with an extensive series of questions before: "How
did you find on our site? Do you understand what our product does? Why
or why not?"

It can begin to feel like you're being interrogated by someone who won't
let you finish your sentences. If you want quality responses, you need
to give people time to think through each individual question.

Bombarding them with multiple points to consider leads to half-hearted
answers by respondents who will just be looking to get through to the
end --- if they even stay with the survey at all. Make things easy by
sticking to one main point at a time.

### Make rating scales consistent

Common scales used for surveys can become cumbersome and confusing when
the context begins to change.

Here's an example I ran into recently. While answering a survey's
initial questions, I was told to respond by choosing between 1-5, with 1
= "Strongly Disagree" and 5 = "Strongly Agree."

Later on in the survey, however, I was asked to evaluate the importance
of certain items. The problem: Now 1 was assigned as "Most Important,"
but I had been using 5 as the agreeable answer to every previous
question.

It was incredibly confusing, and although I realized what was going on,
I have to wonder how many people completely missed this change and gave
inaccurate answers, completely by accident.

### Avoid leading and loaded questions

Questions that lead respondents towards a certain answer due bias in
their phrasing are not useful for your surveys. SurveyMonkey offers a
great example of a leading question to avoid: \> We have recently
upgraded SurveyMonkey's features to become a first-class tool. What are
your thoughts on the new site?

Remember to cut out language that caters to ego or contorts a
respondent's understanding of what's being asked. To avoid loaded
questions, stay away from any presupposed facts or assumptions.

A well-known example on disciplinary action with children is as follows:
\> Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal
offence in New Zealand?

The assumption here is that smacking a child is inherently a part of
"good" parental correction, when in fact that is simply the opinion
being argued. You can avoid loaded questions in your surveys by
eliminating emotionally charged language that hints at preferences or
assumed facts.

### Make use of Yes/No questions

When you are asking a question that has a simple outcome, try to frame
the question as a Yes/No option.

The Survey Monkey study showed that these closed-ended questions make
for great starter questions because they are typically easier to
evaluate and complete.

These questions can also be used to qualify the respondent with less of
an ego bias, such as asking a question like, "Are you considered an
expert in \[blank\]?" vs.Â "What level of expertise do you have in
\[blank\]?"

### Get specific and avoid assumptions

When you create questions that implicitly assume a customer is
knowledgeable about something, you're likely going to run into problems
(unless you are surveying a very targeted subset of people).

One big culprit is the language and terminology you use in questions,
which is why I'd recommend staying away from industry acronyms, jargon,
or references.

One of the worst assumptions you can make is to assume people will
answer with specific examples, or to explain their reasoning. It's
better to ask them to be specific, and let them know you welcome this
sort of feedback:

> How do you feel about \[blank\]? Feel free to get specific; we love
> detailed feedback!

### Timing is important

Interestingly, the Survey Monkey study found the highest survey open and
click-through rates occurred on Monday, Friday and Sunday respectively.

There was no discernible difference between the response quality
gathered on weekdays versus weekends, either, so your best bet is to
seek out survey-takers first thing during a new week or to wait for the
weekend. Perhaps Monday has such high response rates because nobody
feels like working.

### Give them a bonus

It sometimes makes sense to entice customers to take your survey: a
variety of data show that incentives can increase survey response rates
by 5 to 20 percent. These incentives could be a discount, a giveaway or
account credit.

A valid fear is that a freebie may detract from the quality of
responses, but a few studies show that this isn't likely to be the case.
Last but not least, in order to ensure that you don't lose your shirt,
be sure to make incentives something you can financially handle, such as
an extended trial of your software for a period of time.

## Ways of Surveying

Three ways of surveying your end users are:

-   Immediate feedback on any page
-   After some event like the close of an incident or request
-   On a frequency survey

Survey's can be really helpful and I'd suggest having at least one of
the below set up to get a indicator of where you are, and how you can
improve.

ServiceNow's built in survey engine has some room for improvement but is
good enough for most survey's needs. The problem is they are not nearly
as intuitive to set up as [SurveyMonkey](http://surveymonkey.com).

Based on the feedback that you begin to receive you can decide if
additional questions should be asked. However, you want to make sure
that Surveys are **simple and short** so that people complete your
survey.

Follow up on any comments that indicate someone had less then a stellar
experience to get more details Adjust your question in the event that
you find a pattern with comments that people are leaving to ensure you
are capturing the right data

### Immediate Feedback

I love the idea of having a simple "How can we make this page better for
you?" as pictured below. However, I'd have it have a thumbs up, and
thumbs down to submit, and on press of enter submit w/out thumb up or
down value. ![Immediate
Feedback](/uploads/surveys-immediate-feedback.png)

### After an Event

What kinds of events?

-   Resolution of an Incident accepted.
-   Close of an Incident.
-   Close of a Requested Item.
-   Close of a Project.

The key here is **asking immediately** as to keep information fresh in
the users mind.

### Regularly Scheduled

These are great in keeping a heart beat on the satisfacation and other
metrics gathered from the survey.

Pretty much per application, I'd ask some questions monthly or
quarterly.

### Wordpress Minneapolis 2017

This survey isn't short, and asks more than one question at a time. It
also asks questions regardless of answers. Don't do this.
