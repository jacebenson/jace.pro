title: Hactoberfest 2018 - x_8821_atf
---
DigitalOcean and Github for the last few years have put together an event called 
"Hactoberfest" where you can sign up and get a shirt after 5 pull requests.

I've made a repo to build out tests for all of servicenow's tool to help everyone 
get there.

Check it out [on Github](https://atf.jacebenson.com).  

To contribute you just need a personal developer instance and the drive to make a 
test and / or suite to test some OOB functionality.

All tests should be self contained.  What do I mean by that?  Well, anything you 
reference in the test may need to be created like the user you want to impersonate, 
and their group memberships/roles.

I do intend on making a custom test as part of this to make the generation of these 
artifacts easier but I am still learning how the code works for those tests.  
However [this post](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=398d6669dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f9619d2) 
at least is a decent example of someone doing a custom test step.
