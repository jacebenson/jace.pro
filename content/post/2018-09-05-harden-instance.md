title: Harden Instance

A while ago I was tasked to prepare an instance for some penetration
testing. Turns out this is a thing you can do pretty easily.

So to start with you need to know what Servicenow requires of you.
Here's that
[KB](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0538598).

At the time of writing you need these prereqs;

-   Instance must be on most recent patch of supported family.
-   Instance must be unpinned.
-   Instance cannot be prodcution.
-   Instance must have High Security Plugin enabled.
-   [Instance must be
    hardened](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0550654).
-   You can only test once per calendar year, additional testing incurs
    cost.

That hardening guide on the HI site is really thorough. The only things
we couldn't do by ourselves was "Check Whitelist Package Calls" and
"Check Whitelist Member Calls". This will be an issue if you've been
granted access to use something the like [ZipFile java
class](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48190244/read-zip-file-contents-using-zipfile-java-class-inside-script/48196453#48196453)
to zip some files from the server.

There's a great

[my
copy](https://blog.jace.pro/uploads/SecurityBestPractiesAudit-V3_1.xml)
that gets you most the way there I'd suggest starting there. You may
need to configure some things like what file extensions you'll allow but
its easier to do this then to manually create each property. Also it
checks for default accounts and passwords.
