I added a proper newsletter for folks who might want other notifications
on a \~ monthly basis about this blog and things I want to share.

It's on every page at the bottom. I promise it's just for updates
relating to things about what I consider related to this blog.

The technical, I decided to go with Mailjet as it has a pretty good free
tier and they are also by the [mjml](https://mjml.io/) project which if
you havent looked at, you should. I'll wait.

This is just a quick update to let everyone know I have a newsletter.
