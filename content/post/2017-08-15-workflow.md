There are a few things I always think should be considered when using a
workflow.

-   [Patterns](#patterns)
-   [Activities](#activities)
-   [Script](#script)

# Patterns

1.  Always, always add a timer after the Begin activity.
2.  Avoid Switches because they don't update when their conditioned
    field changes.
3.  Avoid Email Activities, instead, opt for Event activities.

Here I have a diagram showing a timer added after the Begin activity.
This timer returns the user's session so it seems immediately which is
great for user experience. However, it makes your workflow dependent on
the events queue. If that goes down, this is the least of your worries.

```mermaid
    graph LR 
    S0[Begin ] 
    T1[Timer]
    R1[Run Script]
    E0[End]
    S0-->T1 
    T1-->R1 
    R1-->E0
```

Next, I have a Diagram showing the Switch, if some changed the
variable/field values of "Standard" to "Mechanical" the workflow
activity won't know to use the new value until you check it out, then
recreate the switch, and check it back in. Because of this, I use If
activities. It is more activities but, because the If activities are
scripted, they won't break when you modify the variable. If activities
used to allow you to create any number of "result" boxes below, one of
them being an "else" but now If's only allow yes and no for results.
Below is an example Switch Workflow and it in the If pattern.

```mermaid
    graph LR 
    S0[Begin] 
    T0[Timer]
    S1[Switch] 
    T1[Task 1]
    T2[Task 2] 
    T3[Task 3] 
    T4[Task 4] 
    R1[Run Script]
    E0[End]
    
    S0-->T0 
    T0-->S1 
    S1--Ergonmic Split-->T1 
    S1--Ergonmic -->T2
    S1--Gaming -->T3 
    S1--Standard -->T4 
    T1-->R1 
    T2-->R1 
    T3-->R1
    T4-->R1
    R1-->E0
```

```mermaid

    J0[Join]
    R1[Run Script]
    E0[End]
    
    S0-->T0 
    T0-->I1 
    T0-->I2 
    T0-->I3 
    T0-->I4 
    I1--No -->B1 
    I1--Yes-->T1

    I2--Yes-->T2

    I3--Yes-->T3 
    I4--No -->B4
    I4--Yes-->T4

```

Last but not least, because I think you should avoid checking out
workflows, always use events in workflows if you need a workflow to
generate a notification. There are some additional steps to take to do
this but it's well worth it because now you can use the notification
records how they are for the rest of the system, you can generate the
notification without the workflow by running the following in a business
rule or any server-side script;

`gs.eventQueue('custom.notification', current, 'parm1', 'parm2');`

Now if you were using variables and are not sure how to pass more than
two parameters, don't fear. Just make your first parm a `JSON.stringify`
object. Sure you'll need to `JSON.parse` the object in the notification,
but now you can pass everything in a way not dependent on the workflow.

## Parallel Flow Launcher

Launches multiple subflows in parallel.

A few things;

-   You **MUST** specify a count, without it, you'll get an error.
-   If you want to get an output from a subflow, in hte Flow complete
    script you can access it via `flow.output`
-   `flow.output` requires the subflow has Return activity.

## Branch

The offical use of this is "Splits the workflow into multiple transition
paths from a single activity."

I like to use this to keep my lines clean.

## Join

Unites multiple execution paths into one transition.

Generally I remove the "incomplete" transistion off of the activity.
Also, **ALL** activities connecting **TO** this must complete.

## Return Value

Returns a value to a parent workflow, when run from a subflow.

## Run Script

Runs the specified script in the scope of the workflow version.

This activity is ver versitile. You can add transisitions based on
values you set in the scratchpad and then have those go off. This is a
great replacement for;

-   Attachment Note
-   Soap Message Legacy
-   Rest Message Legacy
-   REST web service
-   SOAP web service

## Set Values

Sets values on the current record when the workflow quiesces or ends.

## If

Checks a condition or script to determine if a Yes or No transition
should be taken.

## Approval Action

Performs an approval action on the current task.

## Approval Coordinator

Creates an approval whose outcome depends on the outcome of one or more
child activities.

## Approval - Group

Creates approval records for each member of a specified group.

## Approval - User

Creates one or more individual user approvals.

## Manual Approvals

Watches and manages any approvals that users add manually outside of the
workflow process.

## Catalog Task

Creates a service catalog task record. These records are associated to
the workflow via the `wf_activity` field.

## Create Task

Generates a record on any of the tables that extend Task \[task\]. These
records are associated to the workflow via the `wf_activity` field.

## SLA Percentage Timer

Pauses the workflow for a duration equal to a percentage of an SLA.

## Timer

Pauses the workflow for a specified period of time.

This should be added to the begininng of every workflow to have the
workflow run on it's own thread.

## Create Event

Adds an event to the event queue, but does not immediately fire the
event.
