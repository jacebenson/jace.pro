title: Multi Row Variable Sets use a different table to store in the back
authors: ["jace"]

The other day @rfedoruk asked, "Anyone out there in \#ServiceNow /
\#ServiceNowDev ever built anything that allows you to print the RITM
and include variables? Special bonus if it can do it with London's
multi-line variable set feature."

I replied then had some back and forth.

In our discussions we found this new table
`sc_multi_row_question_answer`. I needed to post this before I forget,
as it's useful. Eventually I'll update my varaible scripts to pull from
there too.
