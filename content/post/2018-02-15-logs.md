A [post was made](https://community.servicenow.com/thread/292580) and I
was working through some security stuff of my one. I felt inspired to
make a post about it. Below is a list of logs we need to review
regularly for ServiceNow

Can anyone provide us with Names, Tables, and Sources for the logs
listed?

-   Authentication successes and failures
    -   [Successes](https://.service-now.com/sysevent_list.do?sysparm_query=sys_created_onONToday%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoStart(0)%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoEnd(0)%5Ename%3Dlogin)
    -   [Failures](https://.service-now.com/sysevent_list.do?sysparm_query=sys_created_onONToday%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoStart(0)%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoEnd(0)%5Ename%3Dlogin.failed)
-   Authorization (access control) failures
    -   This would be very verbose and you wouldn't want this.
    -   Do you mean code failures? They would show up as errors in the
        logs... but not explicitly listed for an acl, just an code
        error.
-   Application startups and shutdowns
    -   So. Application startups depends on what you mean
        "applications". If you mean NODES than thats on
        `sys_cluster_state` in the payload look for `servlet.started`
        xml node.
    -   If you mean something else I don't think that's how this works.
-   Configuration changes
    -   this is available on `sys_update_xml`
-   Changes to code files or memory
    -   This is the same as configuration changes. Servicenow has no
        files you can modify like a traditional server, at least not
        that we can access.
-   Application errors and system events e.g. syntax and runtime errors,
    connectivity problems, performance issues, third party service error
    messages, file system errors
    -   [Errors](https://.service-now.com/syslog_list.do?sysparm_query=sys_created_onONToday%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoStart(0)%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoEnd(0)%5Elevel%3D2)
-   Input validation failures e.g. protocol violations, unacceptable
    encodings, invalid parameter names and values
    -   I'd guess this would be in the syslog\_list, but I'm not sure
        exactly the types of things you're expecting.
-   Output validation failures e.g. database record set mismatch,
    invalid data encoding
    -   I'd guess this would be in the syslog\_list, but I'm not sure
        exactly the types of things you're expecting.
-   Session management failures e.g. cookie session identification value
    modification
-   Acceptance of EULA/terms of use
    -   Not ootb, but if you applied
        [servicenowguru's](https://www.servicenowguru.com/system-definition/login-terms-conditions-dialog/)
        then you'd look on the "Terms Acceptance table". However I can't
        find the update set to download.
-   Personal data usage notification/consent
    -   Not sure what you mena by this. Do you mean like HIPAA, PII and
        the like? If so there's nothing to say this ssn, or address is
        added as a comment in the system. You'd have to add that via a
        customization.
-   Attack detection e.g. excessive authentication failures, file upload
    virus detection
    -   See [Auth
        Failures](https://.service-now.com/sysevent_list.do?sysparm_query=sys_created_onONToday%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoStart(0)%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoEnd(0)%5Ename%3Dlogin.failed)
    -   There is no virus checking to my knowledge of uploaded files,
        however you can control the upload types and sizes from these
        properties
        -   System Properties \>
            `glide.ui.strict_customer_uploaded_content_types` restricts
            what can be loaded vs downloaded to stop xss
        -   System Properties \>
            `glide.security.file.mime_type.validation` restricts the
            file's mime type on upload
        -   System Properties \>
            `glide.ui.strict_customer_uploaded_static_content` restricts
            the files somehow
        -   System Properties \> `glide.attachment.extensions` restricts
            the files extensions allowed to be uploaded
        -   System Properties \> `glide.image_provider.security_enabled`
            restricts access to uploads to authenticated users
        -   System Properties \>
            `glide.ui.attachment.download_mime_types` restricts
            downloadable mime types
-   Any other logs that would help identify suspicious, unacceptable,
    unexpected behavior, or other possibly malicious activities.
