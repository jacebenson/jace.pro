title: How to get help faster on community
authors: ["jace"]
---

Often I find questions posted on
[community.servicenow.com](https://community.servicenow.com) to be very
disappointing in that a lot of extra back and forth has to happen before
someone can get the help they desire.

So I think following mostly stack overflow's "[What makes a good
question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)" page would help a
lot of these posts. With that said, I've summuraized what I think are
the important bits. If you follow these recomendation, it's likely
you'll either a) get help sooner, b) solve your own problem and be on
your faster then quickly jotting down a partial question.

1.  Make a good to-the-point title for the question or as stackoverflow
    says, "Write a title that summarizes the specific problem". This
    helps because it lets those who *can* help, know they can without
    going into the post. You might be thinking, I can't sum it up it's
    too complex. No problem, try to think how you'd ask a busy collegue,
    and put that into the subject. If you're still having trouble, write
    the title last after all the details are fresh.

1.  Introduce the problem or write it as you might have explained using
    the [rubber duck debugging
    method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). In the
    body of your question, start by expanding on the summary you put in
    the title. Explain how you encountered the problem you're trying to
    solve, and any difficulties that have prevented you from solving it
    yourself. The first paragraph in your question is the second thing
    most readers will see, so make it as engaging and informative as
    possible.
2.  Help others reproduce the problem. Include just enough code to allow
    others to reproduce the problem.
3.  Do not ask on a old thread for help to a new issue. Make a new
    question.
