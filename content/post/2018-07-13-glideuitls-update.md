How can you use `GlideappVariablePoolQuestionSet` in a scope? You can't!
I've added a script include to GlideUtils to solve for this.

**Update**

This has been removed and code moved to the ["dev toolbox"
repo](https://github.com/jacebenson/x_8821_dev_toolbox/tree/docs)

**Original Post**

So I was working on some things this week and came across some time. I
updated GlideUtils to add a `variableHelper` script include to help
getting variables as that doesnt seem possible in scope with
`GlideappVariablePoolQuestionSet`. As such, this was born.

In anycase, I wanted to post that this is getting updates.
