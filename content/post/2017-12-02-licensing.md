title: Understanding your licensing
authors: ["jace"]
---

So before I say anything about Servicenow Licensing is that your milage
may vary and you'll need to ask your account representive or sales
representive to get the correct answer about if something is or is not
included with your license.

With that being said, Servicenow's licensing has a been a pain point for
some on the community for years. I mean, just load [this page up from
the
community](https://community.servicenow.com/search.jspa?q=licensing). As
of 2017-10-17 theres a lot of information and since every company has
it's own contract with servicenow, it seems they don't generally reply
officially to any of them, however I'll try to aggregate the important
bits below.

Publicly available licensing information

With that being said, this information is based on the sources I found
publicly availabe via

### User Types for Standard Packages

Every employee or contractor given access to the subscription service by
the customer must be assigned a unique username and password that may
not be shared or transferred. Employees and contractors that have a user
profile in the subscriptionservice which is not designated as "active"
may not be given access to the subscription service. The following
describes the types of users requiredfor each subscription model:

-   Fulfillers: (formerly referred to as process users): Fulfillers have
    full admin, developer, or usage rights within a purchased offering.
    This includes the creation, editing, or deletion of any record in
    the system. A Fulfiller is anyuser given a role in the subscription
    service by the customer other than the Approver role.
-   Requesters: (formerly referred to as end users): Requesters create,
    edit, and view their own requests. Requests can be submissions
    through the service catalog or incidents submitted through the
    ServiceNow web or mobile interfaces. They can also access the
    ServiceNow Knowledge Base to perform self service. A Requester is
    any user checked as "active" on his or her user profile in the
    subscription service other than a Fulfiller or Approver.
-   Approvers: Approvers can do everything a Requester does as well as
    approve or deny a record routed to the user (including adding
    related comments/worknotes, however no other field may be modified).
    The Approver may perform the functionalities listed below for any
    approval generated via a ServiceNow built or custom built
    application. An Approver is any user given the ServiceNow provided
    "Approver" role in the subscription service by the customer and no
    other role.
