title: Winning Hackathon Ideas
authors: ["jace"]
---

This year I'm fortunate enough to go to knowledge, and one of my
favorite SN people, Robert Fedoruk, posted a [youtube video about
winning
hackathons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctzX-ANG_Sk&feature=youtu.be).

In the spirit of sharing I'm adding a list I compiled after some
searching to see what's won previously as it wasn't aggregated anywhere
I could see. I'd love to see these shared in an open way after wards but
if this just make the competeition better, than that's great and my goal
here. Below is that list.

    "Pictionary" that replaces that game's manual drawing tools with an

-   MudMonsters - Finalist - "We have 35 locations, 12 monsters, many
    items in there," Scott explained. "We use business rules to govern
    the behavior of all elements. The business rules trigger events
    based off of the text body in the commands. You win when you reach
    the final destination. If you loose, you go back to square one and
    you loose all items."
-   CableCarNow - Finalist - The world famous cable cars of San
    Francisco are always full and the queues at the stops are way too
