I went to the Minnesota SNUG where they had a
[lab](https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/event/knowledge18/LAB1405)
about Software Asset Management. It seems quite involved.

Here's the files from the lab provided instance;

-   Update Sets

    -   [Normalization Suggestion Demo
        Data](/uploads/Normalization-Suggestion-Demo-Data.xml)
-   Excel Import:
    -   [entitlement\_import.xls](/uploads/entitlement_import.xlsx)
