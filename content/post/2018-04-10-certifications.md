After hearing about how certifications are changing I read up on it
some. I found the site confusing, so I made this post to put the useful
things together.

# Certifications

UPDATE \[July 1, 2018\]: As of 7/1/2018 you're need to take a class to
register for the exams [according to this
pdf](/uploads/certifications-faq.pdf).

I was looking for a list of the certifications SN offers. As of today
This is all I can find. Here's my sources;
