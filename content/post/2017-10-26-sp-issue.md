So today I was working on a widget [Accept / Reject Solution](/post/2017-10-26-sp-accept-reject/).  I found a [share](https://share.servicenow.com/app.do#/detailV2/b419262413caa600f609d6076144b030/overview) that looked like it would meet all of my needs.
It looked great, until I tried rejecting a custom extended task table.  

<!--more-->

I couldn't easily set it to work so I backed it out and determined I'd just roll my own, however that share updated a existing `sp_instance`.  After I backed out the update set that `sp_instance` record was still there.  I couldn't get it to fall off the page regardless what I tried;

* Record didn't exist at this point so couldn't delete it.
* Recreated empty table, and inserted the record with the referenced sys_id via [setNewGuidValue](/GlideRecord/#setNewGuidValue).  At this point I could set Active to false, but I wanted it gone.
* Tried Deleting the record from the column record, but it would only ever delete the actual record on it's table and not from the related list of `sp_instance`s.

I ended up making a new column, moving all widgets over, then deleted the old column.
