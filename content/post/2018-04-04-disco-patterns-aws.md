Patterns are a new and interesting thing in Servicenow.

# Discovery Patterns

This is a work in progress, but wanted to share as I will otherwise
never get this down on paper.

First of all let me prefix this with what I had to do to trigger the
pattern for AWS I wanted to use.

Also heres a link to the
[Docs](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-it-operations-management/page/product/discovery/task/t-UseSMPatternForDisco.html).

## Set up

This
[post](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_question&sys_id=c5ec8b29db9cdbc01dcaf3231f9619bf)
and this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_49vxeGz78)
really helped me understand how to get started.

1.  Create a Process Classifier

-   Relate the Horizontal Pattern and the *specific pattern* listed on
    the same line.

1.  Create a New Web Servcie/Region/Logical Data Center

-   Default endpoint `https://rds.amazonaws.com`
    -   Regional endpoing `us-west`
-   Logical Data Center \[`cmp_discovery_ldc_config`\] record with the
    aws account, data center related.

1.  From the aws account record Create the discovery schedule.

-   Update the type to "Cloud services"

1.  Update mid server capabilities to include `all`

## Understanding patterns

Patterns us Groovy as a backend to evaluate any scripts in the steps.

That means you have no access to normal script includes to modify the
data.

With that being said you *can* do most what you did in probes sensors in
the pattern and it's pre/post script handlers.

Patterns are limited to following actions;

| Step                      | Comments                                                                                |

## Pre / Post Processing values

These are records on \[`sa_pattern_prepost_script`\] where you can
massage the data before and after it writes to the database. This
[post](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=c0ac2225dbd0dbc01dcaf3231f96198d)
was really helpful in my understanding of it.

If you're working with the payload, it is the payload for all the found
things. So if you want to modify a "account id" to a reference
(`sys_id`) of a account table, you'll need to iterate over the array of
the items and update each account\_id.

This is my understanding of the payloadObj structure;

``` {.js}
{
    items: [
        {
            className: "cmdb_ci_thing",
            name: "the name",
            u_account: "account id you set here"
        }
    ]
}
```

So the way I handled it was a pre script

``` {.js}
/*
* 1. Pre sensor: You can change payload before it will be proccesed by Identification Engine.
*     Use IEJsonUtility in order to add relevant information to the payload
*     Input parameters in Pre sensor mode: payload, patternId
* 2. Post sensor: You can update/add missing info to the DB based on result (Json) from
*     Identification Engine
*     Output parameters in Post sensor mode: payload
*/

var rtrn = {};
//parsing the json string to a json object

var payloadObj = JSON.parse(payload);
//put your business logic here

var handleAccountData = function(){
    gs.log(JSON.stringify(payloadObj,'','  '),'AWS Service Account ID to GR');
    var returnStr = "Did not replace account value";
    for(var i = 0;i<payloadObj.items.length;i++){
        var item = payloadObj.items[i];
        if(item.className === "cmdb_ci_cloud_database"){
            var account_id = item.values.u_account;
            var saGR = new GlideRecord('aws_account_admin');
            if(saGR.get('account_id', account_id)){
                item.values.u_account = saGR.getValue('sys_id');
                returnStr = "Did replace account value";
            }
        }
    }
    return returnStr;
};
rtrn = {
    'status': {
        'message': handleAccountData(),
        'isSuccess': true
    },
    'patternId': patternId,
    'payload': JSON.stringify(payloadObj)
};
//you can return a message and a status, on top of the input variables that you MUST return.
//returning the payload as a Json String is mandatory in case of a pre sensor script, and optional in case of post sensor script.
//if you want to terminate the payload processing due to your business logic - you can set isSucess to false.
```
