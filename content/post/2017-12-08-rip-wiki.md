With all the annoucements that Servicenow is ending their Wiki, it makes me a little sad.  I had once contributed to the pages before it locked down.  With that being said, I learned a lot from the wiki.  It was probably the second best resource next to the old joomla forum.  With times of change, things go away though.

Many nights at my helpdesk job I remember visiting the Recent Changes to see new features that were made before they could get locked down.  I found so many things a little earlier than I should have because of this.  

To get ready for this post I took a trip down memory lane and looked at the wayback machine.

Servicenow Wiki, you will be missed.

Take a look into the past
