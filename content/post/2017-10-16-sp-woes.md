These are all important things that seemed to have changed from the
standard UI to the Service Portal. Be cautious. Two things I have to
call out. First, this was insired by [Ratesh Shah's
post](https://community.servicenow.com/thread/282244). Second, you can
read "Offical" client script restrictions here on the
[docs](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/build/service-portal/concept/unsupported_client_scripts.html).

## Client Scripting issues

So a lot of things we did in the past in client scripts aren't available
in the Service Portal. In the past, any DOM manipulation or access and
use of window across scripts was just frowned on. With the Service
Portal Service-now has removed the use of those things. So if you want
to use those you'll have to change your scripts below.

### Unsupported client scripting globals

The following globals and APIs are unavailable in client scripts in the
Service Portal.

| Thing      | Description of the thing                                                                                                         |

| `$`        | [Prototypejs selector](http://api.prototypejs.org/dom/dollar/)                                                                   |

| `jQuery`   | [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/)                                                                                                 |
| `$j`       | Alias for [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/)                                                                                       |
| `angular`  | [Angular](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/)                                                                                       |
| `jslog`    | [Docs](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/script/debugging/concept/c_WritingToTheDebugLog.html) |
| `gel`      | Shortcut for `window.getElementByID()`                                                                                           |

## Re-usable utility functions

Macros and any [Jelly](/jelly) are not supported on Service Portal. A
few ways around this would be Widget dependencies or the ScriptLoader
utility.

### Widget Dependencies

In Service Portal, you can add [widget
dependencies](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/build/service-portal/task/widget-dependencies.html)
for re-usable utility functions.

### ScriptLoader

Another way would be to add a [ScriptLoader](/scriptloader) to the
client script.

## UI Type for Catalog Client Scripts and Catalog UI Policies

If you want a catalog client script to work on both service portal /
mobile and regular platform, you must select UI Type = ALL orÂ service
portal / mobile. It may be tempting to simply update every client
script's UI Type to All. for all catalog client scripts, but it may not
be a good idea for performance reasons. Sometimes, there is a valid
reason not to make the catalog client script available on portal due to
functional requirements.

If you want a catalog UI policy to work on both service portal / mobile
and regular platform, you must select Run scripts in UI Type = All. Use
All, Desktop or Service Portal / Mobile based on your requirement as
explained above. This field is not available on the form, you can change
it from list view.

You can use window object to detect if your catalog item is being used
in Service Portal or CMS (Rest of platform).

``` {.js}
if (window) {
    // you are in CMS
} else {
    // you are in Service Portal</em>
}
```
