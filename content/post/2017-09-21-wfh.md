This is more a guide, things I think I needed or wished I had when
working from home.

# Working From Home

I think theoatmeal.com's \"[Why working from home is both awesome and
HORRIBLE](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/working_home) sum's up a lot of
the social considerations to keep in mind. I'll breakdown my opinion of
these things and how to combat them and add a few below.

## Degradation of social skills

-   Work from co-working spaces.
-   Be an extrovert on evenings and weekends (e.g.Â go to Meetups or
    other social gatherings.)

## Distractions

-   Close Reddit/Facebook/Twitch/etc.
-   Don't play games.

## Stress on relationships

-   Have a honest conversation about this with your significant other to
    clear this up. If they don't get it, go to a co-working space on
    days they'll be home, or send them away.
-   Working from home can sometimes give the impression you have time to
    do things you shouldn't do;
    -   fold laundry
    -   rotate laundry
    -   do dishes
    -   clean the floors

## Loss of regimen

-   It's crucial to have a set of hours you're working and then stick to
    it.
-   This tells you when you need to get up and when you need to get out.

## Lack of employee banter

-   The only thing I can suggest here is physical interactions with
    people.
-   They don't have to be co-workers, but anyone.
-   Go to a co-working space.
-   Your cat/dog cannot provide this.

## Stay active

-   Go for a walk on break, get away from your office when you do.

## Don't skimp on equipment

-   Here's the things I'd suggest having;
    1.  Computer Chair (you'll be logging hundreds, if not thousands of
        hours in this thing, get one that's comfortable)
    2.  [Active Noise Cancelling
        headset](https://www.amazon.com/Plantronics-Voyager-Focus-B825-Headset/dp/B013F4LJTI)
    3.  Webcam (sometimes you just need to see someone's face, sometimes
        someone needs to see yours)
    4.  Mouse and Keyboard (again you'll be spending a lot of time with
        these devices, make sure they are great for yourself to use)

## Other things I can't fit in

-   Change into a "work" outfit.
-   Always be ready/able to mute yourself.
-   Live by the phrase, "Two is one, one is none."
