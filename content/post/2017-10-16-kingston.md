## Flow Designer & IntegrationHub

ServiceNow速 Flow Designer is a new Now Platform feature in the Kingston
release.

Enable process owners to use natural language to automate approvals,
tasks, notifications, and record operations without having to code. Use
a single design environment to author flows and actions and manage flow
executions.

Lower the barrier for automation and accelerate development by creating
an ecosystem of reusable content available to any flow. Reduce upgrade
times and technical debt by replacing customized business logic with
native Now Platform actions.

## Agent Intelligence

ServiceNow速 Agent Intelligence is a new Now Platform feature in the
Kingston release.

Use machine-learning algorithms to set field values during record
creation such as setting the incident category based on the short
description. Train predictive models to act as an agent to categorize
and route work based on your past record-handling experience.

## Function Fields

ServiceNow速 Function fields are a new Now Platform feature in the
Kingston release.

All supported relational database management systems (RDBMS) provide a
common set of built-in functions that can be used in SQL statements:
string, mathematical, and so on. Function fields and function scripts
let application developers and administrators use those functions in the
platform in an integrated and familiar way without requiring any
knowledge of SQL or RDBMS specifics.

Notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/platform-support-functions-rn.html)

## Email Digests

Enable an email digest, a single email that summarizes the activity for
a notification during a digest (time) interval that you specify. By
enabling an email digest for a selected notification, you can reduce the
number of emails received when associated records are frequently updated
during a short time period. Admins create the email digest format for a
notification and control the digest intervals that users can choose when
enabling a digest in their notification preferences.

Notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-release-notes/page/release-notes/servicenow-platform/notifications-rn.html)

## Service Portal

ServiceNow速 Service Portal product enhancements and updates in the
Kingston release.

Service Portal is a portal framework that helps you build a
mobile-friendly self-service experience.

### Order Guide Widget

Finally the order guides are available and decent with Service portal.

### Font Awesome upgraded to 4.7

The Font Awesome library has been upgraded to version 4.7 and includes
new icon names and syntax changes. If your Service Portal implementation
includes custom use of the Font Awesome library, you may need to update
icon names in your custom widgets.

### Announcements

Use announcements to broadcast messages to Service Portal users.
Announcements can be displayed in an announcement banner or an
announcement widget instance.

Announcements are active on new instances. To activate announcements
after upgrade, activate the Service Portal Announcements
(com.glide.service-portal.announcements) plugin.
