This post is a extension of this
[post](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=f10eaa2ddbd0dbc01dcaf3231f961925).
Below I go over the videos, and the interactive site.

## Official Documentation

There's 2 places that have this;

-   [Docs](https://docs.servicenow.com)
-   [Developer](https://developer.servicenow.com)

## Foundations eLearning (videos)

There are 6 modules as part of the foundation course. You will get an
introduction and overview of how to interact with and navigate through
this Foundations course. It also covers on how to navigate using filters
and breadcrumbs and what you can see and do as a System Administrator.

Both of these end up on the same videos as listed in sub sections.

## Get a Developer Instance

So you can get your own instance to mess around from
[developer.service-now.com](https://developer.service-now.com/). This is
requirement for the Developer training courses.

## Developer Training Courses (interactive)

Self-paced developer training modules are available with the ServiceNow
Developer program. They are step-by-step, guides on how parts of the
platform work.

## Prepare for the certifiaction

Servicenow does offer classes for the certifications, I wrote about them
on [/certifications](/certifications). But in short I'd suggest studying
the appropriate blueprint;

`*` No Certification Documentation could be found, but it's listed as if
one exists [on the Certification
Guide](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow/other-documents/training/tp-certification-guide.pdf).

## Taking the certification

Update \[July 1, 2018\]: As of 7/1/2018, its stated you need to take the
class prior to testing for the certification. However, the webassesor
link still works and lists the classes for me.

Servicenow uses onsite testing and at home testing. For the at home
testing you'll need a detacted webcam.

At this time the cost is \$150 per certification.

The CSA and CAD certification has a 90 minute time limit. The rest have
a 130 minute time limit.
