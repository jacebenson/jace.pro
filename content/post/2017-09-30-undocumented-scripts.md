I am starting to make a page I can easily reference with things that
Servicenow just omits about their code.

-   Server-Side APIs (gathered using
    [Xplore](https://share.servicenow.com/app.do#/detailV2/9a1be70e13800b000de935528144b04c/overview)
    manually and via posts on community)
    -   Glide
        -   get()
        -   checkInitiated()
    -   GlideAbstractBucketCollector -- Expects Object
    -   GlideSysAttachmentInputStream
    -   GlideChecksum
        -   calculateMD5CheckSum.
    -   GlideSecurityManager
        -   setUser
    -   GlideTableCreator

    -   GlideappCatalogItem
    -   GlideappQuestion -- [Memory Leak issues
        (PRB697208)](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0596785)
    -   GlideappVariablePoolQuestionSet
        -   generally used to print out variables and answers in email.
            I recommend: /printing-out-variables/
        -   https://community.servicenow.com/thread/284468 -- not
            working in scoped application
        -   https://community.servicenow.com/thread/221479 --
            controlling what variables show up
    -   GlideZipOutputStream aka Packages.java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream
    -   GlideZipEntry aka Packages.java.util.zip.ZipEntry
    -   GlideRecord.applyEncodedQuery -- found in activity definitions
        -   This applies an encoded query to a record and sets it's
            values.
    -   task.wf\_activity
        -   Note: the wf\_activity field is disabled in the dictionary,
            so is not visible in the form or list views. But it is still
            valid to use in a script.

        -   Clearing this out on tasks when "restarting" workflow will
            reuse tasks, if you clear this out, it will make new.
        -   I had a requirement where a customer wanted a "Revert to
            New" UI Action inside a Change record but wanted to keep the
            history of Closed Incomplete Change Tasks to show that a
            change failed and had to be restarted

        Every time I'd restart the workflow it would re-use the
        previously made change tasks and overwrite information that we
        wanted to keep for history's sake. -- Lee Hollister
