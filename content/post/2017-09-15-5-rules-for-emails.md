Rules to follow for emails in Servicenow.

## Do not use the Servicenow provided email address

-   [Always set up your own
    mailbox](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/jakarta-servicenow-platform/page/administer/reference-pages/concept/c_AlternateEmailConfigurations.html)
-   Once someone knows about the email address, they never, ever, forget
    it, at least now you can get rid of it or change it accordingly.
-   Changing the "From" on notifications can't be set without setting
    this up.
-   This puts all the content submitted on your own servers, not
    Servicenow's and that makes it much easier to deal with if any legal
    trouble should arise, you have the source and control it.

## Events or Workflow Activities? Always Events and here's a list of reasons why

1.  Allows the triggering of the notification from any server side
    script by just triggering the event.
2.  Faster prototyping of the notification because you won't need to
    complete the 28 step request to get the last email, you can just
    trigger the notification on sysevent.
3.  Events can also trigger Script Actions which allow you to run server
    scripts.
4.  Workflow notifications, in the past at least, haven't been the same
    as notifications you can define outside of workflows.
5.  Workflow notifications require you to checkout the workflow to
    update the notification.

## Only send email notifications if you have to

-   Ideally, emails require action and can be handled from the email. If
    they cannot, consider summarizing that information for a email sent
    on a recurring frequency.
    -   Examples of actionable subjects with commentary
    -   RITM1234 Laptop Approval for Bart Simpson
        -   Can be handled on your phone, searchable by record number,
            what it is and who it is for
    -   Reminder to Please take this survey related to Request INC1370
        -   Should be as concise as possible, so I'd start at "Take this
            ..." or just "Survey for INC1370"
    -   ServiceNow Customer Satisfaction Survey for INT3389
        -   From HI as of August 2017
-   Informing users is sometimes useful, but may also be unnecessary.
    -   Examples of informational subjects with commentary
    -   INC1370 Opened on your behalf
    -   INC1370 Resolved
    -   TASK1234 Provision User Access Assigned to you (cannot be
        handled on your phone, so essentially, you're informing someone
        they have work.)
    -   TASK1235 Revoke Location Access Assign to your group (cannot be
        handled on your phone, so essentially, you're informing someone
        they have work.)
-   One way to sending more useful content less often is to send out a
    summary notification daily or weekly if they have things they need
    to be informed about. Don't send a summary if there is nothing to
    tell them about.

## Decide if you want users to be allowed to unsubscribe to actionable, or informational emails

> Actively discourage the use of Inbound Email as a mechanism for ticket
> creation. It should only be used when the sending party is a robot.
> Over time, the conditions desired by your stakeholders, and the
> propensity for user input error will make inbound email a horrific
> mess. Its also like Pandora's Box. Once you tell users they can email
> into ServiceNow, they'll never stop. I force stakeholders to sign off
> to knowing about a 30% failure rate if they want inbound email
> processing. --
