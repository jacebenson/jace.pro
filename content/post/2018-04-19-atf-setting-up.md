Here's our set up.

## Scheduled Runner

We created a local admin account in our non-productions.

Then we added a powershell script to launch the browser to the scheduled
runner.

## Test configurations

I prefer making the records user, the user's membership as part of the
test to ensure I have a clean, working state instead of picking a user
who may have that role.

1.  Create a base Test, a test you will have everyone start from that
    does the following;

-   Create a user
-   Create a user membership
-   Impersonate the new user

1.  Do the actual test.

## A few things to remember

-   Don't test code you don't own.
-   Test's should be independent.
-   Test good/bad path. Meaning, if you add functionality for x group,
    verify it doesn't exist for y group.
