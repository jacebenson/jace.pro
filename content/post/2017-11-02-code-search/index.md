I've created one of these to improve on the one on
[share](https://share.servicenow.com). This is a scoped application for
Service-now to allow easier searching all code sources.

## Features

-   Table of Contents of results
-   Inline code that is found
-   Sys ID Search

## Setup

1.  Open Studio on your environment
2.  Import from source
3.  Paste in the following URL:
    `https://github.com/jacebenson/servicenow-code.git`

## Usage

After you import this, you can start to use it by navigating to `/code`
on your instance.
