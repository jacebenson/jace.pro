Hey everyone,

I just updated the layout of the home page for my blog.  I also did some... standardizing of the format's of the markdown files.  I did a pretty good look over, but if you see anything bizarre please let me know on [github](https://github.com/jacebenson/blog/issues/new/).

Thanks a bunch.  I appreciate all of you!
