Hey everyone,

I just updated the layout of the home page for my blog. I also did
some... standardizing of the format's of the markdown files. I did a
pretty good look over, but if you see anything bizarre please let me
know on [github](https://github.com/jacebenson/blog/issues/new/).

Thanks a bunch. I appreciate all of you!
