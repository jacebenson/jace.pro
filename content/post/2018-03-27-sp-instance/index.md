Turns out you can apply CSS to a instance record

I had no idea you could do this. This may have saved me from cloning a
few widgets had I known.

If you `ctrl+right-click` a widget and open the
`Instance in Page Editor` you can apply CSS to supersede the css defined
in the widget.

This is a short and sweet tip.
