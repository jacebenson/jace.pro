title: Search trick on table

So during one the Let's code happy hours, Josh Nerius made a point to
call out this tip while looking for a table.

If you are used to typing `sys_user` or `user` and then scrolling and
picking the table, this will save time. Try typing `[sys_user]` instead
as it will have an better match.
