title: glide.system.locale
description: "The value is of the format Language.Country where the language is an ISO 639 language code and the country is an ISO 3166 language code. Internally, this value is used as specified by Java. The system locale setting should be in the Java supported locales list. NOTE: Do not change this value once a system has gone into production. If a user's locale must be changed, update the \"Country code\" field on the user record. The value of this property determines the system's default currency into which all prices are automatically converted before other sums or conversions are performed. Changing this property after any price or currency fields have been given a value (for Service Catalog items, Assets, Project Tasks, etc.) may result in improper conversion or prices that sum incorrectly.
