title: glide.invalid_query.returns_no_rows
description: Controls how invalid GlideRecord queries are handled. When this property is true, invalid queries always return no rows. When this property is false (default), if a query is incorrect, such as by including an invalid field name, the invalid part of the query condition is ignored and results are based on the valid part of the query.
