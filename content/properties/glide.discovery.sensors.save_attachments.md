title: glide.discovery.sensors.save_attachments
description: "Save ECC queue attachments: The normal behavior for discovery sensors is to delete attachments to ECC queue entries upon successful sensor processing. Setting this property to \"yes\" overrides this behavior, and forces attachments to be preserved. This would normally only be useful for debugging purposes. "
