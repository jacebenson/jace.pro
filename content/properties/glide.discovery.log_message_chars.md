description: Specify the maximum length a log message can be before ServiceNow creates a preview for it in the list view. When a log message is longer than this value, ServiceNow creates a preview of the message with an ellipsis at the end of the message to indicate that there is content that is not shown. The preview size prevents any one list row from taking up the entire screen.
