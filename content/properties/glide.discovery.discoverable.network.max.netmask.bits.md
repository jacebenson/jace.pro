title: glide.discovery.discoverable.network.max.netmask.bits
description: "Maximum netmask size for discoverable networks (bits). The maximum number of bits in a regular netmask for networks that will be discovered by Network Discovery. By \"regular netmask\" we mean a netmask that can be expressed in binary as a string of ones followed by a string of zeroes (255.255.255.0 is regular, 255.255.255.64 is irregular). Regular networks are commonly expressed like this: 10.0.0.0/24, which means a network address of 10.0.0.0 with a netmask of 255.255.255.0. Larger bit numbers mean networks with smaller numbers of addresses in them. For example, the network 10.128.0.128/30 has four addresses in it: one network address (10.128.0.128), one broadcast address (10.128.0.131), and two usable addresses (10.128.0.129 and 10.128.0.130). Small networks like this are commonly configured in network gear to provide loopback addresses or networks used strictly by point-to-point connections. Since these sorts of networks generally don't need to be discovered by Network Discovery, it would be useful to filter them out. By setting this property to a value of 1 through 32, you can limit the sizes of regular networks that are discovered. Setting it to any other value will cause all networks to be discovered. Irregular networks are always discovered. The default value is 28, which means that regular networks with 8 or fewer addresses will not be discovered."
