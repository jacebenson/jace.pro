description: Synchronize table-specific CMDB modules' and Interceptor answers' active status and roles. e.g., if a CMDB module for a specific table is deactivated, deactivate the corresponding cmdb_ci.do Interceptor answer for that table so it does not appear as open when creating a new CI, and vice versa. Likewise, if roles are modified for one, update the other.
