title: glide.email.forward_from_prefix
description: "When determining if an email is a forward, this field is used to match against something in the body. This traditionally was \"from: \", but can include other words or words in other languages, each separated by commas. For instance \"from: ,da: \" would search for either \"from: \" or \"da: \". Either would allow the email to be classified as a forward. Leaving the field blank, means no search will occur, and the software will not require anything in the body for matching a forward. "
