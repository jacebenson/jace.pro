title: glide.email.forward_from_prefix
description: "When determining if an email is a forward, this field is used to match against something in the body.  This traditionally was 'from:', but can include other words or words in other languages, each separated by commas.  For instance 'from:,da:' would search for either 'from:' or 'da:'.  Either would allow the email to be classified as a forward.  Leaving the field blank, means no search will occur, and the software will not require anything in the body for matching a forward."
