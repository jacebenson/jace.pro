title: glide.db.max_view_records
description: Sets the maximum number of records returned when running a GlideRecord query in a script. Values larger than the default are not recommended as they may cause queries to consume excessive memory on the application server and can, in extreme cases, cause a system outage. This property does not control the maximum number of records that appear in a list, report, or exported file.
