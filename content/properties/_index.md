This is the list of `sys_properties` on my PDI today.\
Sometimes I want to search these and yhey aren't all listed on the docs
or developer sites. Also It's a place where I can put gems if I find em.

Also these two graphics come on the docs regarding property name
conventions, so I'll include theme here to help identify what a property
may be related to.
