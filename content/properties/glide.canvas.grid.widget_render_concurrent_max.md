description: Defines the maximum number of widgets that can render simultaneously on a dashboard. With smaller values, individual widgets load more quickly. With larger values, fewer Ajax requests to the server are needed. Set the value of this property to half of the number of widgets that are visible when your most-used dashboard loads. For example, if six widgets are visible on the dashboard set the value to 3.
