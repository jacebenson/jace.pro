There are a few things I always think should be considered when using a workflow.

# Patterns

1. Always, always add a timer after the Begin activity.
1. Avoid Switches because they don’t update when their conditioned field changes.
1. Avoid Email Activities, instead, opt for Event activities.

Here I have a diagram showing a timer added after the Begin activity. This 
timer returns the user’s session so it seems immediately which is great for 
user experience.  However, it makes your workflow dependent on the events 
queue. If that goes down, this is the least of your worries.

Next, I have a Diagram showing the Switch, if some changed the variable/field 
values of “Standard” to “Mechanical” the workflow activity won’t know to use 
the new value until you check it out, then recreate the switch, and check it 
back in.  Because of this, I use If activities.  It is more activities but, 
because the If activities are scripted, they won't break when you modify the 
variable.  If activities used to allow you to create any number of “result” 
boxes below, one of them being an “else” but now If’s only allow yes and no 
for results.  Below is an example Switch Workflow and it in the If pattern.

Last but not least, because I think you should avoid checking out workflows, 
always use events in workflows if you need a workflow to generate a 
notification.  There are some additional steps to take to do this but it’s well
worth it because now you can use the notification records how they are for the
rest of the system, you can generate the notification without the workflow by
running the following in a business rule or any server-side script;

`gs.eventQueue('custom.notification', current, 'parm1', 'parm2');`

Now if you were using variables and are not sure how to pass more than two 
parameters, don’t fear.  Just make your first parm a `JSON.stringify` object.
Sure you’ll need to `JSON.parse` the object in the notification, but now you
can pass everything in a way not dependent on the workflow.

## Parallel Flow Launcher

Launches multiple subflows in parallel.

A few things;

- You **MUST** specify a count, without it, you'll get an error.
- If you want to get an output from a subflow, in hte Flow complete script you can access it via `flow.output`
- `flow.output` requires the subflow has Return activity.

## Branch

The offical use of this is "Splits the workflow into multiple transition paths from a single activity."

I like to use this to keep my lines clean.

## Join

Unites multiple execution paths into one transition.

Generally I remove the "incomplete" transistion off of the activity.  Also, **ALL** activities connecting **TO** this must complete.

## Return Value

Returns a value to a parent workflow, when run from a subflow. 

## Run Script

Runs the specified script in the scope of the workflow version.

This activity is ver versitile.  You can add transisitions based on values you set in the scratchpad and then have those go off.  This is a great replacement for;

- Attachment Note
- Soap Message Legacy
- Rest Message Legacy
- REST web service
- SOAP web service

## Set Values

Sets values on the current record when the workflow quiesces or ends.

## If

Checks a condition or script to determine if a Yes or No transition should be taken.

## Approval Action

Performs an approval action on the current task.

## Approval Coordinator

Creates an approval whose outcome depends on the outcome of one or more child activities.

## Approval - Group

Creates approval records for each member of a specified group.

## Approval - User

Creates one or more individual user approvals.

## Manual Approvals

Watches and manages any approvals that users add manually outside of the workflow process.

## Catalog Task

Creates a service catalog task record.
These records are associated to the workflow via the `wf_activity` field.

## Create Task

Generates a record on any of the tables that extend Task [task].
These records are associated to the workflow via the `wf_activity` field.

## SLA Percentage Timer

Pauses the workflow for a duration equal to a percentage of an SLA.

## Timer

Pauses the workflow for a specified period of time.

This should be added to the begininng of every workflow to have the workflow run on it's own thread.

## Create Event

Adds an event to the event queue, but does not immediately fire the event.
