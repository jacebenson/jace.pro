event_url: "https://servicenow.g2planet.com/knowledge2019/myevent_session_view.php?attendee_id=4524&session_id=326&agenda_session_id=260"
location: "Las Vegas, NV"
summary: "Two years ago, I started a ServiceNow developer Meetup to do ad-hoc labs, problem solving, and happy hours. I wanted a place to cut the fluff and talk shop with other like-minded developers. In this session, I'll show you how to be an influencer and build your own community with Meetup. I'll share my experience and go over what it takes to run Meetup events such as finding venues, getting content, the importance of food, and much more."
abstract: "Introduction and Problem Statement: Two years ago I started a Developer Meetup for servicenow talent to do ad-hoc labs and have happy hours.  I didn't want what happened to the SNUG's happening to this event so I volunteered.  

Approach and Results: Running the event has been a ride and I would do it all over again.  In this session I'll go over what it takes to run these events.

Attendees will learn how to:

    Identify how often and about what the meetup should meet about.
    Finding content to use for labs and / or for happy hour discussions.
    Finding hosting locations in your area."
