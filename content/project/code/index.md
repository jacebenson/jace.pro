This is my version of a code collabortation tool as it seems most eventaully go offline or start charging money.

It's a customized version of [FirePad](https://firepad.io/) with a bunch of options from [codemirror](https://codemirror.net/).

CodeMirror Features in use;

- [Themes](https://codemirror.net/demo/theme.html)
- [Gutters](https://codemirror.net/demo/marker.html)
- [Linting](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#addon_lint)
- [Languages](https://codemirror.net/mode/index.html)

The page on default makes a shared space named after this moment (see url).
If you share that url others can change it.  There is no cleanup at the moment.  I manually do this on an infrequent basis.
