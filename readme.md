**Steven Woodson**

The style guide was inspired by a [great talk on the Eleventy Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mhA2bH6q8s). Steven also wrote a [blog post](https://stevenwoodson.com/blog/eleventy-style-guide-generator-step-by-step-guide-adding-to-an-existing-site/) about that.

**Aleksandr Hovhannisyan**

Aleksandr seems to value a well-structured project just as much as I do. It was the repo from aleksandrhovhannisyan.com that inspired me to write the article [Organizing the Eleventy config file](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/blog/organizing-the-eleventy-config-file/). The 301 redirect solution I'm using is from Aleksandr's article.

**Manuel Matuzović**

Manuel is an accessibility expert. The menu I was using as default up to v2, is very much inspired by an article Manuel wrote on web.dev.

**Bernard Nijenhuis**

Bernard wrote the article on which the Open Graph Images implementation is based.
